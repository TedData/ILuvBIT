1
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.490
Xiangguo Sun: hello, everyone can you hear me, can you hear my voice.

2
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.590
Xiangguo Sun: Hello.

3
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.470
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, thank you, and this is time that start.

4
00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:16.980
Xiangguo Sun: So this is the week eight and now we're going to talk about some basic idea about the lecture in this way, you know in this doctor doctor doctor doctor give us and lecture on the Community detection and then the license right so in today in this way, so actually we need to.

5
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:34.080
Xiangguo Sun: analyze the Community in the social networks and there also is this some very important not content which might exist in your final exam so i'm just going to point it out the important things and.

6
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.820
Xiangguo Sun: and give some details analyze this about that.

7
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:51.120
Xiangguo Sun: So, once the Community community in the real world, we have many Community just like we can also named as a group, or just as some clusters.

8
00:13:51.600 --> 00:14:09.360
Xiangguo Sun: or clubs right that says that such as the economic growth, spiritual growth and and all the student in our class can also be treated it as the group or the Community, but in honest networks, the Community or more frequently refer to refer to the.

9
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:33.000
Xiangguo Sun: Some individual which helped connection between each other, so in this way, the Community, we have to find these groups in this one as works and we make a name that has said that detection and then we need to evaluate how better how well of our model to find this Community.

10
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:51.480
Xiangguo Sun: Please, know that the Community detection is one of the most important or the fundamental tasks in the social networks, so we were to come to the online social networks, you can see, you can think about many different tasks such as.

11
00:14:52.710 --> 00:15:05.940
Xiangguo Sun: I just said, listen to some common tasks here which named arca know the classification, the Community television and Linda prediction and the corral classification and I think this fourth house is the.

12
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:17.910
Xiangguo Sun: Most basic things in the officers networks and many tasks in the real application can be treated it as a one of them are, for example, the another classification is.

13
00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:30.090
Xiangguo Sun: to identify the nose labels in their networks right, so we can we can use them to detach the rumors it has the spammers or.

14
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:45.900
Xiangguo Sun: classify users attributes and for the Community detection, which aims to find the cluster or groups in in the social networks and for the link prediction, which will be elaborated in.

15
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:58.830
Xiangguo Sun: The in the next few weeks and which means to predict whether a pair of given node having links or having edges behind them so.

16
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:20.370
Xiangguo Sun: It cover second project just aim to find that that the link the link between each each powerful knows right and that the first time, is about to grab class classification, for example, each tweet or each content in and that's where tempe retweeted or can be Kansas to.

17
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:35.640
Xiangguo Sun: propagate across the network, so it has his own provocation graph, and so we can treat each this graph as the the instance of a of a message, and then we just try to.

18
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:52.770
Xiangguo Sun: classify the crowd as different categories so that's correspond to the the tweets or the contents labels, so this some the basic idea about this for task and I don't want to do and other one you got don't the Community toxins, so one of them.

19
00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:03.450
Xiangguo Sun: But Community times, he has his own features, for example, a canal assurance that the cluster or the Community in the Indian.

20
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:12.210
Xiangguo Sun: ocean data which are usually different from the real world real world situations, for example, at the nose in the Community should be.

21
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:19.230
Xiangguo Sun: strongly connected our stories, it should be our internal to the united and there should be.

22
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:33.690
Xiangguo Sun: More links with thing that the Community, other than the length between different communities, so when them that the weaknesses between different nosy but you with a strong Internet connection between the.

23
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:45.030
Xiangguo Sun: And the idea that the the commercialization of the logical router to be completely destroying notate that that's the main difference candidate should.

24
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:55.290
Xiangguo Sun: I don't have any path of don't have any length between each other right, but in the real world This situation cannot be.

25
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:04.680
Xiangguo Sun: cannot be always there because in a in a rowboat we only, we can only find within the Community.

26
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:16.470
Xiangguo Sun: which might have some you know how some some communication between the Community, so we just need to find the Community.

27
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:30.060
Xiangguo Sun: As much as as we can, so in order to find a community which treat we were transport we transform the problem as the grass carp.

28
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:49.050
Xiangguo Sun: And to defy the minimum cart and so what's the card at the graph if you are familiar with our tutorial in which to which we're I just introduced by new business idea about the graph essentials right, and then you will also be familiar with this concept of cards.

29
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.850
Xiangguo Sun: that's just a record in a week or two, we talked out the minimum tree and the we call about the spring.

30
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:17.790
Xiangguo Sun: algorithms, so I think I have already introduced introduced some basic idea about the card in the graph and, for example, however, have you remember that, in order to conducted the print algorithm we started from one node and the drug ally here or just just like just like here.

31
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:42.600
Xiangguo Sun: Right and then each other to help their values right so we'll just pick one those and then try another night here so as you can see, this line just can be treated as a card so that's So if you attend up if you familiar with a previous lecture you will be also familiar with this concept.

32
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.220
Xiangguo Sun: Is.

33
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:45.690
Xiangguo Sun: OK.

34
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.870
Xiangguo Sun: And a cost means the card in the graph means.

35
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.360
Xiangguo Sun: means.

36
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.160
Xiangguo Sun: Potentially.

37
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:12.780
Xiangguo Sun: The graph into two different set for example in this graph we can find at least three cards for the CAFE which can be which can be divided this word has two parts right another part, and the right part.

38
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:26.340
Xiangguo Sun: that's means is that the parts, the it divides the graph as two separate and also the line be also be treated as a cut and the latency also you can also.

39
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:35.010
Xiangguo Sun: draw other lines as you as you wish to divide this graph as two different or more partitions.

40
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:44.520
Xiangguo Sun: But a more on this card or a month or this line, which is the one to find the minimum the minimum cut means this lunch should across.

41
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:57.420
Xiangguo Sun: As less edges as possible, or why because in our previous slide with that we want to find the Community which have less communication between different.

42
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:08.460
Xiangguo Sun: different communities, so we did the transform the former problems as the as this new problems to find to find a Dominican here.

43
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:28.170
Xiangguo Sun: But in this graph apparently Dominica the minimum card is to Helen eight right because they're all your one ages here and we cannot truth line be because there Hello 12344 agent here so apparently in this situation, the minimum kinda just like a.

44
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:42.270
Xiangguo Sun: That means we just define to Community the love part and the road part but apparently, as you can see the rather have just had one knows that's all clarity comes you know.

45
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:52.470
Xiangguo Sun: As you're in the real world, if you want to find two different clouds or you know, or if we want to find different communities there shouldn't be you know sort of be.

46
00:21:53.610 --> 00:22:16.890
Xiangguo Sun: danced partition right but but, but here we to the spine in balance position so that that's not what we want to find so in order to achieve the Church, as the problem we address the problem by relaxing relaxing the retirement of this.

47
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:36.300
Xiangguo Sun: Of this problem, which means we find that the medical problems are what we change the opposite function to consult with them in this Community, this is, for example in our previous situation, we just need to find the minimum card right, so we just need to calculate the minimum.

48
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:49.920
Xiangguo Sun: Number of these guys so so this equation means the ages, that the ages of a card cross with also said, is that the size of the College.

49
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:59.700
Xiangguo Sun: So in our previous situation we just want to find the minimum value of that, but now, as we can see, we divided by the Community size, why because.

50
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:16.350
Xiangguo Sun: If we divided by Community size, we can say, we can expect to find more balanced, the position, for example, in this case, if you just treated this line, as your choice that means.

51
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.500
Xiangguo Sun: The card or the size of a quarter should be one right.

52
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:28.320
Xiangguo Sun: In the initial in the initial stage with the minimum cut.

53
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.090
Xiangguo Sun: Just a one.

54
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:54.780
Xiangguo Sun: that's now we divided by the petitions size, so we need to calculate the some of the largest other parts which have eight nose and the right side part which have one old and and, as you can see it's larger than one but in our previous slides or in our previous stage.

55
00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:06.240
Xiangguo Sun: developers to one so that's mean when we divided by the Community size, we can find this card might not on no longer.

56
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:14.520
Xiangguo Sun: On not the the the optimal choice anymore, because it, there is a virtual been reduced to further.

57
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:29.280
Xiangguo Sun: Also, we can also divided by the degree some not only by the by the position size that's just I think that this just two different ways to you know to.

58
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:41.100
Xiangguo Sun: To to to regular the the all the opportunity of functions, so we caught this function as the ritual college and we call this function as a novelist card.

59
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:52.170
Xiangguo Sun: And what you need to know is to calculate them, so I just want to remind you guys that might be your final exam maybe I just want to give a draft.

60
00:24:52.770 --> 00:25:04.080
Xiangguo Sun: Like here or or just similar graph and then I will supply with some some cut, for example, other supplied this card this card or this card.

61
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:23.880
Xiangguo Sun: And then name the ABC and then I will tell i've asked you which card is the best card according to ration card or according to the normalize a card, what do you need to do is to calculate the the value of this three cars right, for example, you, you want to calculate the cost a.

62
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.940
Xiangguo Sun: You just need to find.

63
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:40.350
Xiangguo Sun: To follow the previous the previous equation to calculate the value here and we can see this the cut value right because they're only one age across.

64
00:25:41.100 --> 00:26:00.810
Xiangguo Sun: Across cut a and then we divided by different parts size, so this car divide the total that as two part this part the part one and part two, so the so this part only have one oh so we divided by one and the remaining part to have.

65
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:11.430
Xiangguo Sun: had eight notes, or we divided by eight right, and then we normalize the two parts, so we just need to add about two and then we got a funny answer.

66
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:27.900
Xiangguo Sun: We can also calculate and nominate code and also, as you can say, if you do rectally calculate the cut value this car the just the one right and we also find that coffee the coffee.

67
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:45.840
Xiangguo Sun: If will be directly get the value is the you tended to kind of evaluate is too, because they are, how to edge cross cross country, but if you calculate the ratio or the organization called you get different answers, for example, or point 45 and open.

68
00:26:46.890 --> 00:27:00.090
Xiangguo Sun: And as you can see, it will be compared with the regional CARDS, we can find both the original pilot and the normalization Colorado have cut be is smaller than a so if we.

69
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:14.670
Xiangguo Sun: If we calculate the ratio card or the normalization normalize the card, we can say the best choice or the better choice is can be not cut at right, but if we follow our initial.

70
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:27.300
Xiangguo Sun: motivation if we just did a regular guy did cut value, we can see the cut a better one, but the cut the value is too, so the better choice, it should be cut a.

71
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:41.430
Xiangguo Sun: So that's the reason why we want to calculate this thing because, as we can say cut to be divided ground as two separate route and the weekends, if this is to to.

72
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:51.900
Xiangguo Sun: to sort of grab how you know similar size, you know the upper subscribe headphone old and the loudness want you to refine.

73
00:27:52.320 --> 00:28:02.430
Xiangguo Sun: But the cut a divided grab it also at the logic, rather as two separate but they're not you know in Dallas to the other side, as he knows that the rents it's just one of.

74
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:12.330
Xiangguo Sun: Still and there's a reason why we want to calculate the original kind of normalization card and the what you need to do is how to calculate that and I think that maybe he says, your funnels down.

75
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.700
Xiangguo Sun: So that's mean that the boss original code and almost got prefer of balance, the partition.

76
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.380
Xiangguo Sun: and

77
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:34.230
Xiangguo Sun: Anna in order to find the communities, we have two different ways, the first way is that is based on the spectral clustering and the second week, based on the modularity so just so i'm not going to introduce the way.

78
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:41.970
Xiangguo Sun: The method business that true clustering and this content and might be a little company had a complicated or.

79
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:54.630
Xiangguo Sun: Maybe difficult to to to understand, so no no Gary I just asked you to understand as much as as in cat and I will tell you which are part of will is your final exam okay.

80
00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:02.820
Xiangguo Sun: So, before we start this virtual class during we need the first to introduce some concepts of China, then lovelace and metric and.

81
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:22.290
Xiangguo Sun: Actually, the loveliest metric, so I think many of the guys might not fear heard this concept when we talked about the ground, but I think many of the guys had heard the concept of agent metric right so when we talk about the corrals.

82
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:33.210
Xiangguo Sun: We can see how to represent a graph of how to how to is a chronograph in you know in mathematics.

83
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:40.590
Xiangguo Sun: And some students some students, I think of the agent metrics right yeah, but please know that that's the only the one.

84
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:50.280
Xiangguo Sun: way the one method to describe the graph in them in mathematics algebra we have many other ways to you know describe the ground for for a different.

85
00:29:50.670 --> 00:30:02.490
Xiangguo Sun: aspect, for example, you can also describe the ground from the from the degree magic so what degree match with the degree magical, this is actually the diagonal matrix the remaining.

86
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:13.320
Xiangguo Sun: elements that I feel rule but that doesn't elements that is just the degree of progress on the nose right yeah so this degree magic can be treated as one.

87
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:24.240
Xiangguo Sun: methods or when asked about autograph and the week, we can also This is described the graph where by the agent metric right, and now I just want to introduce another.

88
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:43.980
Xiangguo Sun: Natural to describe the ground big called stoplight and metrics and the loudness nitrates can be calculated by the by the degree matrix and by the agent metric so that's means all the remaining elements, you know it's just that the.

89
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:50.730
Xiangguo Sun: The opposite and number of off of the original are eaten metric and all the diagonal.

90
00:30:52.110 --> 00:31:04.440
Xiangguo Sun: At a month is just the degree from the from the degree magic right and many other students might ask, so how how about what if the ground has.

91
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.620
Xiangguo Sun: To look for whatever the graph is directed, but I think.

92
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:26.580
Xiangguo Sun: that's a test out scopes we are out of the scope, we want to talk about so in this lecture is just need to know the empty rhetoric graph and the you just need to know that the graph without any as.

93
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:39.600
Xiangguo Sun: You know self love and that's mean the diagonal elements there's just a degree of a note and the remaining those justin the officer number for the agent metric so that's that that place in that church.

94
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:52.710
Xiangguo Sun: that's a you know very interesting because we have fun in the lab is magic Hello very good opportunity our good qualities, for example, if we use.

95
00:31:53.970 --> 00:32:08.580
Xiangguo Sun: All once factors as the the agent bag terribly we can easily find out what happens naturally has a agent vital equal to zero so that's very important qualities and the weekend also find that the.

96
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:19.050
Xiangguo Sun: agent that values, all the age of banners in the lives of magic and done either by the real numbers and the investors are real and always have again.

97
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:35.400
Xiangguo Sun: The real truth, so all this quantity or their importance in you know, a very good content in mathematics so it's so that we can you know conduct many can calculations by others and that trick.

98
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:48.630
Xiangguo Sun: And, and in order to calculate a special the special costume, we also need this metric to have it as capitalism important ideas so in order to calculate that we've formulated.

99
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.600
Xiangguo Sun: With formally.

100
00:32:52.680 --> 00:33:04.470
Xiangguo Sun: introduce a new manager named X the X is just like this one, and you know each line denote a the corresponding nodes in the graph and each line is.

101
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:10.680
Xiangguo Sun: And each column correspond to the Community, you want to find so basically.

102
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:34.230
Xiangguo Sun: Before we start to find the communication communities, we actually need to assign the total number of communities, you want to find so maybe we just we guess there might exist to Community to communities in the graph that that means this metric is just that and.

103
00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:42.090
Xiangguo Sun: Because to, so it is a has own lines and two columns and each column and correspond to.

104
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.810
Xiangguo Sun: different communities and.

105
00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.960
Xiangguo Sun: The D is just to when we talk about is about the diagonal degrade now trick and.

106
00:33:53.220 --> 00:34:04.620
Xiangguo Sun: We can say this equation can be treated as the number of agents that are inside military I and some students might not understand because why what why there's.

107
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.140
Xiangguo Sun: Okay.

108
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:17.430
Xiangguo Sun: Just one said, why not a D plus at Okay, I just want to answer this question it's very interesting very interesting questions you know.

109
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:28.950
Xiangguo Sun: As we can see the libraries and natural is defined as the degree matrix minor by agent metrics right, but some stores may ask why we not define the metric D class.

110
00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:45.630
Xiangguo Sun: will be why we invest a different a different as the minder actually I did some research about that and that's a very interesting, for example, if you just try to calculate.

111
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:51.930
Xiangguo Sun: That inner product, I mean, for example, if you just try to calculate out that.

112
00:34:53.250 --> 00:35:03.570
Xiangguo Sun: This things you might find some very interesting results, and you can find you might find that if a week defined the monitor by a.

113
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:15.690
Xiangguo Sun: The final equation, will be very beautiful and very you know, simple, but if we define the last place and as the past by a.

114
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:23.340
Xiangguo Sun: In many calculation, the final you know the final results might not be might not be.

115
00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:39.510
Xiangguo Sun: Simple might be, you know added guns so that's not too much things up about the about this, our operations I we just did it is derived from the.

116
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:49.620
Xiangguo Sun: Property jetta from the mathematical OK, so now we come back to this page and I don't want to say why we treat this equation.

117
00:35:50.310 --> 00:36:14.250
Xiangguo Sun: As the number of agents that are inside of music, I meant to the unknown and stand out right, but if you attend our previous tutorial you might get this things that that's a showman eight is the agent natural have a graph and we might use a transform multiply by a.

118
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:16.860
Xiangguo Sun: to denote what.

119
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:28.860
Xiangguo Sun: Have you ever remembered this equation in our previous job yeah I think I have already talked about that you know we're in my use the power of a moment, maybe we just use a.

120
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:37.140
Xiangguo Sun: third set of power of a or a second power of a so what what's the meaning of that.

121
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:46.890
Xiangguo Sun: You know the metric a means no die and know the J whether whether know the eye and a note the tree have.

122
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:58.320
Xiangguo Sun: One hobby lately or have direct age right, so the this the meaning of match guy and then we just deal with the we use this guy's.

123
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:15.390
Xiangguo Sun: which can be also treated as the second power of a to denote what to denote brother know the eye and an obituary have to hop lyrics right so If not, I know that you have to have links, we can see.

124
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:27.360
Xiangguo Sun: The corresponding might be equal to non zero of that was right and now that's just a seat try to analyze this guys.

125
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.310
Xiangguo Sun: i'm just going to your eraser to clean clean my.

126
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.930
Xiangguo Sun: screen.

127
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:39.240
Xiangguo Sun: And as we can say the metric X denote.

128
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:46.410
Xiangguo Sun: The presentation of each node and the credit increase bonding.

129
00:37:47.520 --> 00:38:00.570
Xiangguo Sun: increase bonding Community right Okay, so that means this our communities, and these are knows, so that means that X arbitrary means note I.

130
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.320
Xiangguo Sun: know that I whether belonged to.

131
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.320
Xiangguo Sun: Community Community J.

132
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:16.740
Xiangguo Sun: Right so X means leather note I belong within minutes to check.

133
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.940
Xiangguo Sun: Maybe we can use this to denote the.

134
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:31.140
Xiangguo Sun: denote that means okay so let's try to calculate the transpose of X and the transport of X.

135
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:48.840
Xiangguo Sun: coming to this this word so each line become the Community, but each column become corresponding nodes right so that's mean that that transpose of X means means what means each other.

136
00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.270
Xiangguo Sun: A.

137
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.550
Xiangguo Sun: target community has corresponding note J.

138
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.170
Xiangguo Sun: Right.

139
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:20.460
Xiangguo Sun: And now we calculate we just further to remove this metric and that's see that the try to consider what's the meaning of X transpose multiply by X what's that mean that means.

140
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.290
Xiangguo Sun: Community I.

141
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:27.120
Xiangguo Sun: Has.

142
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.300
Xiangguo Sun: A Member node name Jay.

143
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.830
Xiangguo Sun: And this Nova Jay has also.

144
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.080
Xiangguo Sun: Missing another Community okay.

145
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.880
Xiangguo Sun: Right so actually you can say this.

146
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.650
Xiangguo Sun: metric can be treated it as the number of nodes here inside Community I.

147
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:10.230
Xiangguo Sun: Right, and now we just to put this metric back into the original equations because the matrix a is just the different nodes.

148
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:21.360
Xiangguo Sun: presentations in whether they have an agent that so so that's me among all this about here's how many of them how been conducted by ages.

149
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:40.680
Xiangguo Sun: So that's the menu, while we say that that's equations and never agent that are inside the Community hi okay so that's how how I understand this equation, and I guess many other guys might not might still cannot understand what I said right.

150
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:55.650
Xiangguo Sun: But nobody about that just doesn't try to consider that after those tutorial and if you have your new idea about this questions you're welcome to post any ID thinkings in the piazza.

151
00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.930
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so Similarly, we can also treat this.

152
00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:11.610
Xiangguo Sun: Like also treated this equation, as a number of age that and that's to the mentoring opportunity I, and you can also try to you know to attend.

153
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:29.550
Xiangguo Sun: This process as what I do, and then you can just try to consider what what many, and then we can come come to the conclusion that this equation can be treated as the number of agents in the card that the printer that dignity, I don't know.

154
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:40.860
Xiangguo Sun: So that's the reason why we replace the original equation, as the metric form because this guy's cannot be calculated in mathematics right, so we just.

155
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:56.100
Xiangguo Sun: grab that Batman better match performance and then we've got the final equation here and, as you can see, this adjuster, and this is just the last lesson metric and this guy seems like you know, since like.

156
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.370
Xiangguo Sun: A project in function, you know.

157
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:11.460
Xiangguo Sun: The X, this is just the project each node to value right, and if you have to come communities, we have to.

158
00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:24.390
Xiangguo Sun: Each knows how to value, and if we have 10 communities each node has turned out so it's just like each line just it can be just like that the feature of a note right.

159
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:36.510
Xiangguo Sun: So we just can be treated as a feature so but that's mean the feature transformed by the lab is metric and then we try to find a minimum of that.

160
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:48.720
Xiangguo Sun: And that and that's the reason why we're trying to find the minimum of these equations but this and then i'm going to.

161
00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:56.550
Xiangguo Sun: tell you how to find the Community by this equation and.

162
00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:15.990
Xiangguo Sun: As well as what we will what I have said, we can treat each line as the know the feature right, so now we want to find the different clusters and if we have some data mining.

163
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:24.870
Xiangguo Sun: courses that, then you might be fun, we can use the class current method to you know to divide this nose.

164
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:35.250
Xiangguo Sun: into different population So here we does a trade with the with the team is mothers to find the clusters and and the number of cluster equal to two.

165
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:46.140
Xiangguo Sun: So each line, it can be treated as know the features and we were feeding this feature to the kidneys model, and then the output, the different positions, and then we can find.

166
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:59.490
Xiangguo Sun: This three and those are the three nodes in correspond to the latter part and then a three node crap on to the band called so the Community should be about it here.

167
00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:15.210
Xiangguo Sun: So that means the track that's better classroom actually translate the Community finding as clustering method right the Community that the corral as not.

168
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:24.060
Xiangguo Sun: Is such a complicated and cannot be treated as know as a euro samples in your.

169
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:40.620
Xiangguo Sun: Practical data mining us task so when you first get to extract the features of each node so what's the feature of that and then with this that maybe we can construct this.

170
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:56.430
Xiangguo Sun: metric to to you know to to to get some some not know the features, so we just have constructed methods and then we calculate the agent vectors and we treat each of the end of this node, as you know, as the.

171
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:11.730
Xiangguo Sun: Other features and then we treated it with filters feature to the kidneys models and then the output is the final presentation that to the death of the basic idea about as clustering and I think you just need to understand.

172
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.500
Xiangguo Sun: The.

173
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:23.580
Xiangguo Sun: The model that's enough you don't need to understand how to calculate that and how to do that so maybe you just need to understand what I said here.

174
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:36.450
Xiangguo Sun: So, given the lapis nitric wispy firstly find that the top K out innovators are because they trust down to the smallest by those and computed and denote as X.

175
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:49.920
Xiangguo Sun: So Center some sort of my students cannot understand why we try to find the aging factory correspond to the smallness engine values, why do we.

176
00:45:50.490 --> 00:46:09.450
Xiangguo Sun: Why did we not try to find the top key NGO vector correspond to the to the largest it agent letters what what while it's fine to choose to use the smallest anywhere else, and if you want to understand that you might need more advanced knowledge.

177
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.730
Xiangguo Sun: about the graph theory.

178
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:28.380
Xiangguo Sun: And now i'm just going to do some some in this show explanation, but if you cannot understand what that sounds no worry about that okay so to travel back to China some what what what I said so.

179
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:34.530
Xiangguo Sun: Basically, this is that to say this, this is the graph.

180
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:43.740
Xiangguo Sun: And that is the we have we have function which can map each node to a to a.

181
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:50.130
Xiangguo Sun: city value here okay so actually we just use.

182
00:46:52.380 --> 00:47:03.870
Xiangguo Sun: This to denote their value Okay, so this means their value, my less than zero and negative value and this mean theory there might be positive.

183
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:22.890
Xiangguo Sun: And as we can say ah, in a draft we usually take the assumption that the nose conducted by and he sort of be you know, should be similar so that's me this value and this vital you know shouldn't be similar.

184
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:34.890
Xiangguo Sun: But this is true, and this value, you know we're we're not we don't ask them to to to guesstimate so that that means if you treat this.

185
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.120
Xiangguo Sun: knows as the locations on the ground.

186
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:50.010
Xiangguo Sun: You can just draw a you know, a curb or drug plan, and you can see, this picture, just like the mountain you know the difference knows.

187
00:47:50.490 --> 00:48:03.330
Xiangguo Sun: Just like a mountain today the different nodes if they have the connected ages this this rupee closely, there should be close but, but if a note in repair for no they don't have they don't have.

188
00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.690
Xiangguo Sun: A connection there might.

189
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.790
Xiangguo Sun: change it hugely.

190
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:18.570
Xiangguo Sun: And that means in this graph we can't you know we can't mirror some changes about this about it and.

191
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:40.710
Xiangguo Sun: We can see some sometimes the change it, it does for some moves right, but sometimes that the change is you know gymnastic so how to mirror the degree of these changes and then some mathematics some students or some research and fine, we can actually.

192
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.600
Xiangguo Sun: decomposing decomposing decompose the.

193
00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:53.010
Xiangguo Sun: lovely symmetric two different agent values and, as we can say the larger.

194
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:55.440
Xiangguo Sun: The larger.

195
00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:04.500
Xiangguo Sun: agent values, corresponding to a agent right, so if we treat this factor as an F.

196
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:29.010
Xiangguo Sun: That we can find the project of the value chain, the hugely or change dramatically, but if for our agent values of various more the corresponding the crass about the agent voucher if we treated it as dumb as we can see the project has value change smooth.

197
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:45.870
Xiangguo Sun: Care industry innocent what is that so that means if we're trees if we choose that the smallest eight new values and the truth that the corresponding agent factors as projecting belters or as a project or as.

198
00:49:46.800 --> 00:50:00.090
Xiangguo Sun: We can find you know the project of the value chain very smooth that's a very cute quality that that's a very good quality, because they are more similar than the.

199
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:02.550
Xiangguo Sun: More similar.

200
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:09.450
Xiangguo Sun: in real life situations, for example, if I am front of you.

201
00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:22.320
Xiangguo Sun: We might have very similar you know hobbies topics, or even personality right, but if we don't know each other, we don't have any notion, we might be very different person.

202
00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:32.550
Xiangguo Sun: persons and we add trade talk about this topic in our previous slides Have you ever remember the concept of names that have affiliate.

203
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:49.620
Xiangguo Sun: Right, so the hammer Philippines even to people who have a notion, they will become similar estimator right so following this concept of following this you know motivations, we aim to find some protection function F.

204
00:50:50.640 --> 00:51:07.260
Xiangguo Sun: with him to find this over to project the notes to two different value, but we want to try to make sure the battle changes very smooth on the graph and that's the reason why we want to find the smallest and the vitals and to find this angel factory to compute as a graph.

205
00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:15.450
Xiangguo Sun: And then we construct you know constructed the notice dangerous by this way having gotten this features, we just.

206
00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:26.040
Xiangguo Sun: created this feature to the chemists marlo and then to try to find different art classes and some students might also asked me this question, so in this.

207
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:34.860
Xiangguo Sun: slide with it we tried to find a top caitlin of actors right but, as we can say the largest metric accurate can help.

208
00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:46.980
Xiangguo Sun: And it'll doctors so sheldon you tell me to find the smallest agent values but there, how many videos so that to say that the agent vital might be 4.1.

209
00:51:47.580 --> 00:52:06.330
Xiangguo Sun: upon the 2.3 or four and it into upon ny so you tell me to find that the smallest the smallest integrated, but how many agent value that I found and actually in the real situation in the real practical applications that K, we just.

210
00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:10.380
Xiangguo Sun: familiar with the K equal to the number of.

211
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:23.970
Xiangguo Sun: Communities you want to find but that's not the strictly that that's not that the strict demand that actually did you can adjust the decay, but, as you can say, if you find all the.

212
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:30.990
Xiangguo Sun: values that means you're also include include some you know some.

213
00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.320
Xiangguo Sun: High Frequency.

214
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:42.060
Xiangguo Sun: innovators in your model right but we actually just want to find some low frequency.

215
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:50.790
Xiangguo Sun: angel voters so maybe the best ways to only choose one but, but if you only choose one definitely the feature just a one.

216
00:52:51.900 --> 00:53:05.160
Xiangguo Sun: Right, so that might reduce the performance of the bounce rate has so many which has two to three or four and you know, Mr says to adjust it according to herself so in the in the practice.

217
00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:26.520
Xiangguo Sun: We just did our we're used to to find the key agent valid through visitation to be equal to the number of candidates, but not but that's not strictly the market and having failed the audience feature to the Indians values are the communities, and then we can try to find the.

218
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:33.030
Xiangguo Sun: transcripts of that so we shouldn't eat cloud story as dignity at work front.

219
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:43.560
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so that's the class terrain, that the spectral clustering and up to now, I think some of some of the guys had already know why we caught.

220
00:53:44.700 --> 00:54:01.320
Xiangguo Sun: We call this Mailer as bagshaw clustering because, as you can see we're actually treated with regular treated the agent values, as you know, as the frequency of graph right and the frequency crust on to.

221
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:15.960
Xiangguo Sun: Their own projecting functions so it's just a system like the sabbatical calculations, in the second a process of courses, so we just named that that the special class trip.

222
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:26.220
Xiangguo Sun: And also, we have another new mother named model modular fashion magazine ization and just as a way to try to answer some questions.

223
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:42.270
Xiangguo Sun: or some stuff that Jay said how do we choose harmon agent voucher to yeah I just answered that question tested before some saying like yeah you can treat the last line something.

224
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:49.200
Xiangguo Sun: Related to those digital ocean, but I think that that the province is really can be also you know.

225
00:54:49.830 --> 00:55:05.160
Xiangguo Sun: treated it as the project and functions, for example when either function to match each user to you know to real value in the in the little space, so we we usually call that the project and function.

226
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:10.380
Xiangguo Sun: is different from the piece a picking the top a larger.

227
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:12.960
Xiangguo Sun: pieces are.

228
00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:28.710
Xiangguo Sun: Sincere how to produce a pneumatic on please, yes, you can have it there has some similarity but they're all different and and, if I remember right that the PC mother, they can be treated as an attendee.

229
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:37.140
Xiangguo Sun: directly from the special guest today, I think you need to understand that to read more reference about that, but I don't remember it clearly.

230
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:41.010
Xiangguo Sun: i'm reminded me something yes and.

231
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:42.570
Xiangguo Sun: OK.

232
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.430
Xiangguo Sun: So now we just let's continue continue to.

233
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:55.830
Xiangguo Sun: Continue the other methods to detect Community Member modularity so the modularity is not a.

234
00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.770
Xiangguo Sun: Strict but it's not a.

235
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:12.420
Xiangguo Sun: strange concept, because we just wonder about that, before right, you know that the audacity and the modularity and many other different concept, so in the following.

236
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:21.690
Xiangguo Sun: slides maybe we just need to record the concept what we had talked about the previous slides so.

237
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:25.950
Xiangguo Sun: Some of some of the guys May.

238
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:28.620
Xiangguo Sun: say.

239
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.320
Xiangguo Sun: This concepts, you know.

240
00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:53.460
Xiangguo Sun: What we call that what that we call the the configure model, if I remember that yeah the configuration model, but actually the configuration model, the only purpose of introduced the complete configuration mode it just to let you understand why.

241
00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:09.360
Xiangguo Sun: Why we you know inside the modularity in this way, or why we use this equation to denote the probability between different nodes to highly ages, so that means, if you have already know.

242
00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:25.200
Xiangguo Sun: How it comes you actually don't need to understand now the configuration models right because the only purpose to introduce this morning, just to help you understand them better okay so let's just take a brief overview about that so.

243
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:35.070
Xiangguo Sun: For the galen did great sequence with the first generate and those and you know each node for.

244
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.600
Xiangguo Sun: Some stats right, and then we just need to.

245
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:53.280
Xiangguo Sun: follow in a follow the the take rate sequence and try to connect them each other so as you can see, this case there's a case of desiccated be or how the equal probability.

246
00:57:53.700 --> 00:58:03.690
Xiangguo Sun: And the your task is to calculate the probability of this to know that, having having connected among all of the.

247
00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:14.970
Xiangguo Sun: Total total to a cadence right, so how to calculate that maybe we need to first give your degree techcrunch here and what you need to know is, is to.

248
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:34.170
Xiangguo Sun: repeat this node according to this value or to the degree, for example, this know degrades to repair that ties and we also repeated the second know Thailand twice, so if this the greatest sorry, maybe we just repeat at certain times right and after that we randomly shuffle.

249
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:39.720
Xiangguo Sun: The sequence we run us through a sequence and connected the.

250
00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:50.310
Xiangguo Sun: The agent knows, so that means another way another way to should be ignited, so we should have B one B two and a reduced rate and ethical kinds of we wouldn't be talking a bit right.

251
00:58:50.580 --> 00:59:04.290
Xiangguo Sun: And the which will be a three ignited yes and the week three we weren't connected so according to this short form we can generate a case here, and this case it just a normal case among all.

252
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:10.680
Xiangguo Sun: This total cases so just a one is right also you can also.

253
00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:17.070
Xiangguo Sun: get a different answer, because it is the brand Michelle for some Maybe you can get this answer if you can do this as you.

254
00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:28.470
Xiangguo Sun: can either we went to be one so that's me to have the self agent here, and then, which would be three to reach three different kinds of the here so as you can see, this also they're bringing their typical kisses kisses.

255
00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:32.100
Xiangguo Sun: So not too much different.

256
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:39.030
Xiangguo Sun: Important in the information here, and then you can do to find out why we.

257
00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:47.760
Xiangguo Sun: Try to define the possibility in this way, maybe you can use the configuration model to help you to understand that, I think, maybe in the.

258
00:59:48.420 --> 01:00:05.790
Xiangguo Sun: You know, in your final exam maybe I can just give it the the wrench over here, and then, as we are to to draw the corresponding graph here, so I think that might also very important here, because it does it for for the for the for the.

259
01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:11.100
Xiangguo Sun: exam but I don't think it's very important to end to have understand that.

260
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.190
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so.

261
01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:28.230
Xiangguo Sun: And now we come to the normalized modularity with a little different from our previous concept, because it never prepare concerned we did we only.

262
01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:53.850
Xiangguo Sun: calculate you know the total graph modularity right but, but now we will we, you know we particularly at different sub graph so the also trained some your kingdom allows the here so for permission he acts we firstly defined a distance the distance is the ah real connections.

263
01:00:55.050 --> 01:01:08.910
Xiangguo Sun: Mother bye expected connections and don't forget this, this is the pervasive between different nodes getting connected right so so is the real connection, and this is better the condition so we've been married the.

264
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:19.320
Xiangguo Sun: difference of measure the distance of that, and this is just for one edition, and we can play for different positions, so we can tell you that the.

265
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:26.790
Xiangguo Sun: generalize distance and the phenomena as a version of this in terms of defined as modularity so we just.

266
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:41.670
Xiangguo Sun: treat this as a way to end the, as you can see, this might be a little similar to our previous model but but but have also some difference right because this maharaja accurate defined based on different petitions, not the whole graphs.

267
01:01:43.230 --> 01:02:00.240
Xiangguo Sun: And, and for this, the things I don't send you guys to understand that we don't need to say about having defined of modularity in this way that the next step is to you know, to find the the better choice P, that the better choice, he to to make this about a smaller.

268
01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.560
Xiangguo Sun: So the company COM, the optical mother's.

269
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.870
Xiangguo Sun: Okay.

270
01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:18.270
Xiangguo Sun: And haven't found that many evaluations, the most important thing is to evaluate how how well our business models.

271
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:23.700
Xiangguo Sun: And please know that this part is very important because they have some calculation confidently in.

272
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:36.570
Xiangguo Sun: front of them, and the most important things you need to calculate know to add one score to be core precision or minority or the karate or calculate that so before the capital that we just given some.

273
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:53.880
Xiangguo Sun: Some basic definition Okay, so it is a sin be coming to two hours so okay so let's try to have a little break and we'll come back a few minutes later okay.

274
01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.610
Xiangguo Sun: hello, everyone can you hear me now.

275
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.040
Xiangguo Sun: I come back.

276
01:12:58.230 --> 01:12:59.550
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, good Thank you.

277
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.070
Xiangguo Sun: Okay okay good Thank you so that let's continue.

278
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:12.480
Xiangguo Sun: This apart, is the most important part in this Wednesday, this week, so we need to calculate some different.

279
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:30.840
Xiangguo Sun: index, and now we just need to into some basic idea of a basic concepts so what's the perfect the perfect community, which means to overcharge Incirlik 90 of the same time right, but actually what we can offer to achieve this goal in the real world population.

280
01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:32.340
Xiangguo Sun: More.

281
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:43.800
Xiangguo Sun: Common situation is is in one Community we might have different kinds of nose, so we just want you.

282
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.430
Xiangguo Sun: In matter how well this model perform.

283
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:49.350
Xiangguo Sun: and

284
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.690
Xiangguo Sun: What I lost my mouse.

285
01:13:55.710 --> 01:14:12.480
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so the first things is about some concepts about precision precision P, the record are So the first thing is you guys need to calculate to know as to how to calculate to this to.

286
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:24.330
Xiangguo Sun: A different values, and if you took if you have a choice that the data mining or machine learning courses, I think you will not be to.

287
01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:37.740
Xiangguo Sun: string of that so to concept, right at the very positive but it's something might be a little different in a different phone your previous situation is we actually.

288
01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:40.650
Xiangguo Sun: have some you know.

289
01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.050
Xiangguo Sun: Different or has some have some individual.

290
01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:58.770
Xiangguo Sun: Definition about the true positive and the true negative, for example, a true positive means with similar members peers are assigned to the same communities.

291
01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:12.900
Xiangguo Sun: were treated that as a credit is in some reason that this not the nose the nose hairs and the similar nose hairs assigned to the same communication, for example.

292
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:18.960
Xiangguo Sun: In this rabbit try to calculate the to the true positive true partner here.

293
01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:27.060
Xiangguo Sun: So how to calculate a true positive way, according to the destination, we need to find the similar.

294
01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.880
Xiangguo Sun: Note pairs.

295
01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:37.020
Xiangguo Sun: In the same community right OK, so the same know the pair.

296
01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.010
Xiangguo Sun: In the same community for this Community.

297
01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:59.820
Xiangguo Sun: How many hairs from the same note the same the same level, maybe this one, this one pair two pair three four actually just a combination of this one right, so we came is the combination of.

298
01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:06.390
Xiangguo Sun: Following Those are just two those two notes and the order to calculate that that, as you can use them.

299
01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.250
Xiangguo Sun: I think my calculated in this way.

300
01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:16.200
Xiangguo Sun: And I minor to.

301
01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:17.700
Xiangguo Sun: This way.

302
01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:26.100
Xiangguo Sun: Right so actually you need to know how to calculate that Okay, so this is a for the.

303
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.930
Xiangguo Sun: The read.

304
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:40.200
Xiangguo Sun: The rather simple round numbers and we can't we need also to calculate this one, but in this one, we just need to calculate what one.

305
01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:50.460
Xiangguo Sun: To two and, apparently, is it with your friends, so we don't consider it Okay, so how about this notate notate you know, has two different those.

306
01:16:51.420 --> 01:17:16.140
Xiangguo Sun: Are the first the blue node has six so we We selected any to knows from this six nodes right and, similarly, we select any no tears one is to note and don't calculate the total number, so the total number is 26 so that's the true positive is 26.

307
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:26.910
Xiangguo Sun: Also, the true negative is different, but nose hairs to India different noticed.

308
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:38.490
Xiangguo Sun: Right so that's made the T shirt to wear T T T here is different nodes in different no date so that's mean if we consider this note.

309
01:17:39.150 --> 01:18:00.960
Xiangguo Sun: Is Bruno it should be connected by the rest randall in different Community so there's a two by the pedal up by one and also this 12345 it find out here and it's so connected to the blue nose in other communities wise will come Community here.

310
01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:03.000
Xiangguo Sun: Okay.

311
01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:26.670
Xiangguo Sun: So follow this exam you can calculate this this and all this thing and then you might be asked to calculate the precision and recall and some students might have noticed that in this example we only have two Community guys, but the destination.

312
01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:44.640
Xiangguo Sun: It just that communities, so the total come into numbers, more than two so if we have another camera here, for example, this is my route and this might this might are.

313
01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.120
Xiangguo Sun: Blue maybe.

314
01:18:49.410 --> 01:19:03.900
Xiangguo Sun: Then, how the capital did that or that or how to calculate this guys and apparently the tp it's just following the previous week right, but when you try to calculate the teton.

315
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:11.310
Xiangguo Sun: You need connected at this guy's to this to nose and also to this note.

316
01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:18.150
Xiangguo Sun: right that may be a little different but they all follow the same idea.

317
01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:38.670
Xiangguo Sun: What I mentioned, there why I Muslim this because I think your findings are maybe you're you might be asked to calculate the precision or the recall that things so you need to force you to calculate this big thing right.

318
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:51.990
Xiangguo Sun: And, apparently, you know in our previous slides if if you're asking some some calculations if the equation is really difficult or complicated that we might.

319
01:19:52.650 --> 01:20:16.110
Xiangguo Sun: provide this equation to you in your exam right, but in this test as we can see, this is not equation, this is not equation not equation equation so that's the main in this case, if you're asked to calculate the precision, what I can give you is only this.

320
01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:26.850
Xiangguo Sun: or this right, but you still need to know how to calculate a true positive enjoyment of it is actually a win when know.

321
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:37.590
Xiangguo Sun: The definition and they too different from our previous situation because the other end of our previous task that is that the notification on another house.

322
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:59.670
Xiangguo Sun: We also focus on the nose not know pairs a here what we were to their peers as one credit discern or wrong decision right but but in most cases, we just a tricky one note as one credit ation of one different or one a wrong decision.

323
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:13.320
Xiangguo Sun: So doesn't mean, I can only give you this equation, but you need to be familiar with a definition of this guy's is dasher when maybe you are, you might encounter more than two minutes, so I think that's very important.

324
01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:24.750
Xiangguo Sun: And having calculated the precision and recall, then you can use this equation to direct say get the F1 score and it's also very important.

325
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:27.750
Xiangguo Sun: So you just need to calculate that.

326
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:28.410
Okay.

327
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:35.730
Xiangguo Sun: Forgive me just need to quit at the beach.

328
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:37.800
Xiangguo Sun: Okay.

329
01:21:39.390 --> 01:22:05.280
Xiangguo Sun: And the besides the F1 precision and recall, you also need to be familiar with the purity and the purity I think it's also very easy to to to understand you know that the ci is the members into the time and the lj as the labels in all communities, so this just.

330
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:10.770
Xiangguo Sun: The Internet international history different.

331
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:22.830
Xiangguo Sun: South so you just to find the maximum number and calculate the summation of that now, for example, are in this graph and the total number.

332
01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:31.530
Xiangguo Sun: Of a nose 12345 it voting right, so we don't do a 14 justice into this one, and in this case.

333
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.500
Xiangguo Sun: That say how to calculate that.

334
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.150
Xiangguo Sun: The see one's done number in okay so.

335
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:59.400
Xiangguo Sun: Is the set of Members incremental Okay, so we should see one here is 123456 right Okay, so this have a six and.

336
01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:08.070
Xiangguo Sun: The lj the set of insulin level checking all communities.

337
01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:12.900
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so first all this node.

338
01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:15.660
Xiangguo Sun: understand this.

339
01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.800
Xiangguo Sun: Is what this is all blue.

340
01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:21.870
Xiangguo Sun: Note.

341
01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:35.250
Xiangguo Sun: Right so first we calculate all numbers in cluster one so it's it's up to us to notify class one.

342
01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.250
Xiangguo Sun: And it should be intercepted this.

343
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:51.600
Xiangguo Sun: All blue nose so that's me is tested that intersection of this node and all these nodes this note there's no the snow the snow is all.

344
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:55.500
Xiangguo Sun: Right and the insurgent it just here.

345
01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.110
Xiangguo Sun: Since the number.

346
01:23:59.130 --> 01:23:59.670
Xiangguo Sun: Two one.

347
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:05.100
Xiangguo Sun: Right, this one is targeted for.

348
01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.910
Xiangguo Sun: What it is targeted for.

349
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:15.390
Xiangguo Sun: The for the nodes in cluster one.

350
01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:22.650
Xiangguo Sun: And also, we try to calculate the red note in cluster one.

351
01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:32.040
Xiangguo Sun: cemetery in order to calculate the right node in Castle one you can find the numbers for the 12345.

352
01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:35.760
Xiangguo Sun: and

353
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:46.110
Xiangguo Sun: we've found the massive value, so it seems to be fine 12345.

354
01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:52.680
Xiangguo Sun: So, this would calculate we're finished at the first the first Community.

355
01:24:54.030 --> 01:25:04.890
Xiangguo Sun: And then we need to cover another another Community you know right so in the country to, we need to find the intersex section of.

356
01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:13.320
Xiangguo Sun: The offer handled and intersection of balloon node as a fighter Magnum.

357
01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:18.120
Xiangguo Sun: And then calculate the total submission of that.

358
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:24.330
Xiangguo Sun: You know, basically so it's not difficult but it need your you know to.

359
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:41.490
Xiangguo Sun: To to take your need you to focus on on the inside, because you might miss it many similar concept right, so I highly recommend you guys to you know repeat this after you finish this tutorial and before the the final exam okay.

360
01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:44.940
Xiangguo Sun: and

361
01:25:46.230 --> 01:25:57.090
Xiangguo Sun: Another mother is the nutri information and I don't think they're smiling this final exam because the calculation of that might be a little different.

362
01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:11.550
Xiangguo Sun: A little difficult, so if I did want you to calculate that maybe I will directly give you this equation and show you the manual does so you just need to know.

363
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:20.850
Xiangguo Sun: The value of that and the theoretical demonstrate that see another, but I don't think that my new over it with them, so you can just to be familiar with that okay.

364
01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:30.600
Xiangguo Sun: yeah just be familiar because they Christians that data difficult if you want to truly understand this guy's meaning.

365
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:48.720
Xiangguo Sun: You need to run more advanced knowledge in the information theory, so you can take take some courses about that, but here i'm not going to tell you more about that, because then we'll a little difficult to understand.

366
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:50.310
Xiangguo Sun: Okay.

367
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:58.440
Xiangguo Sun: So here is Ah yes, here is an example here to calculate you know calculate.

368
01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:04.350
Xiangguo Sun: The information on the military from the information right, so you just need to so.

369
01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:21.480
Xiangguo Sun: If it did, in your exam maybe, just like go in this way, so we just need to follow in this way to tell me that to you know, took to assign a value here right, that is, the H a ll to send a letter here and the photo.

370
01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:26.490
Xiangguo Sun: photo this equation to theoretical neutral information.

371
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:27.270
Xiangguo Sun: that's enough.

372
01:27:27.690 --> 01:27:31.170
Xiangguo Sun: that's enough Okay, so in the same so we finished all.

373
01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:34.740
Xiangguo Sun: content in this way.

374
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:43.410
Xiangguo Sun: Or, this is the way I, you know that the nurse awake are we don't have the lectures, but we still have online tutorial and the ultimate tutorial.

375
01:27:43.800 --> 01:28:01.560
Xiangguo Sun: So that's I mean the Internet so fill in the next week or the week night I might introduce some cases study in our first project, you know some students want to know the result of research project right, so I might have some know less about that and also.

376
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:14.460
Xiangguo Sun: In this answer all your questions in the next few weeks, and if we still have some time I might introduce some basic idea about the link, in particular because.

377
01:28:15.210 --> 01:28:28.890
Xiangguo Sun: That in web turn we tend to it go that the second project and the last night, what well when students asked me to choose not to collect some useful resources about.

378
01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:40.950
Xiangguo Sun: The second project ah, I will also try to try to some of the photos are for you guys and the moon might release them in that's the way to target okay.

379
01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:55.590
Xiangguo Sun: Some students that can be two more examples incidents returns next week yeah Okay, if you want, maybe I can supply business more example in specialist right yes wait.

380
01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:59.280
Xiangguo Sun: What is he about.

381
01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:01.620
Xiangguo Sun: A two.

382
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:08.580
Xiangguo Sun: Which slide you're asking the a to not understand what you're talking.

383
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:30.450
Xiangguo Sun: I mean that's okay that that assignment to it's just the project too fast for the link and redemption which will be elaborated in way to turn after that the public holiday and but I don't think you guys can hold the on that project, because there have been some.

384
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:40.020
Xiangguo Sun: Some some some some difficult test up to understand, for example, like to link the positive link and how to evaluate the results.

385
01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.210
Xiangguo Sun: Last year.

386
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:46.170
Xiangguo Sun: Many students students how.

387
01:29:48.120 --> 01:30:05.610
Xiangguo Sun: questions on project to but let's student has have problem on our President wanted, because the President and to might be a little difficult or unusual than feature to a real job trivial task.

388
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:13.860
Xiangguo Sun: yeah it's a big and little hard but, but nobody about that, and you know in this year, maybe change some.

389
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:31.980
Xiangguo Sun: Some content about project to to make the requirements more clear and to to make the task more more easy to to solve, so I will also talk about them in our next week Okay, so this is all about today's tutorial and thank you for attending.

390
01:30:34.050 --> 01:30:40.230
Xiangguo Sun: If you have no other positions, maybe we can just live Okay, have a good day.
