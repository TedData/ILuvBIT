20
00:12:48.780 --> 00:13:05.580
Xiangguo Sun: I think I want check the your submission again so so that means after today, maybe I will formally started the evaluation for our first project, so I encourage you to submit that, as early as possible okay ah.

21
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:20.220
Xiangguo Sun: You say, have any further help of how you know first approach in this way, you can just get one of the things our appointment and and that.

22
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:35.790
Xiangguo Sun: In this option, I think I have more than three students are new need to meet with me so i'm a little busy today and, if you want to make an.

23
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:43.560
Xiangguo Sun: Appointment appointment, maybe you have to choose tomorrow or this weekend.

24
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.600
Xiangguo Sun: And don't hesitate to send me your email to me again appointment with me.

25
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.630
Xiangguo Sun: So, as you can say.

26
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.490
Xiangguo Sun: In the.

27
00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:08.940
Xiangguo Sun: In the previous weeks, I mean from bigger to to big cities that lecture slide is merlin electric slide isn't many produce bump bump by myself and the derivative that by this is sassy another.

28
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:23.580
Xiangguo Sun: Another tutor over this course, but from this week's and in the following weeks the the slides will milling produced by Miss Johnson, and then I will try my best to corroborate with her.

29
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:36.300
Xiangguo Sun: We can't are will will work, work, work together to make the the following slides good, and I have also too I also need to tell you that.

30
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.090
Xiangguo Sun: Some of you guys might be.

31
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:51.060
Xiangguo Sun: Preparing for your final exam now so as you can say it if you are preparing for our final exam at the most important content.

32
00:14:51.600 --> 00:15:15.840
Xiangguo Sun: manning come from the past six weeks so from way to to two weeks with six the content of during this period, during this period, might take you up about more than 6% 60% of your final exam So if you are focusing on your final exam Maybe you can just start to.

33
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:26.790
Xiangguo Sun: record the content from week to week seven from being to to be six and for for this week and into the end of the Semester.

34
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:44.490
Xiangguo Sun: That content might be more easier to understand and your want need to focus on that that the calculation to manage and monitor content you just need to be familiar with that and I think some of them might be.

35
00:15:45.270 --> 00:16:03.960
Xiangguo Sun: You know, might be more advanced topics so maybe they're even out of scope in your intellectual or in the desk the lecture or in the following tutorial, so I will so in the photo ways I will.

36
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:15.750
Xiangguo Sun: tell you which points are important in in the final exam but, but then you will find most of the content, you just need to be familiar with that and that's enough.

37
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:26.280
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so in today there's also means in in the following weeks out we actually don't have too much to say about the.

38
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:46.560
Xiangguo Sun: The contents, you know the because the continent might be very easier and maybe the Tongue will be short, but if you have any further questions in previous slides I mean from week to week itself, but she took to make things you can also propose the question to me okay.

39
00:16:48.330 --> 00:17:00.780
Xiangguo Sun: So in today's material our, as usual, I will first try to elaborate on the Queen the Queen for, and then we will try to introduce some basic idea about this week's lecture.

40
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:17.610
Xiangguo Sun: And the week, for I think the focus on the content phone with sex and we're men and talk about the society that influence the hammer fairly and account balance right, and this is the first question in our in the quiz for.

41
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:32.400
Xiangguo Sun: So the first question says, which of the following statements around and that the first item, when individual get a connected, one can preserve this wasteful a certificate in their connectivity.

42
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:41.250
Xiangguo Sun: not work, and I think that straightforward that are absolutely right right for the.

43
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:54.000
Xiangguo Sun: For the similarity between two people, which are connected, so I think this statement is correct, and the second in networks versus other activity.

44
00:17:54.510 --> 00:18:05.460
Xiangguo Sun: This is similar nodes are connected to one another, more than similar knows, and this apparently around because they're so talented actress nervous minority.

45
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:20.940
Xiangguo Sun: and add the fourth the third section, the third choice as activities, the most common composer the paradigm upon on Lincoln individual, and I think there's this right and the three common forces it ruins the.

46
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:32.850
Xiangguo Sun: home affiliate and a confounding you can still find that these three guys in the lecture right so that's just the take up briefly, I take a brief overview of about.

47
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:51.300
Xiangguo Sun: The influence to have affiliate and a confounding and I think you just need to be familiar with the concept, the concept that's enough, for example, users need to know what's the influence the influence, maybe means the.

48
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.760
Xiangguo Sun: user.

49
00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:03.390
Xiangguo Sun: effect and now another years or so, it just the character, the process, you know the process between two years or and.

50
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:26.850
Xiangguo Sun: In order to preserve the influence you need to make sure these two guys are the two years are actually connected, because if we're isolated with each other, they cannot affect each other right so visit the influence and in order to in order to analyze info influence the further.

51
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:42.150
Xiangguo Sun: We also propose a very famous algorithm that the influence model right and we'll talk about later in the algorithm and for the home of La is actually.

52
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:52.410
Xiangguo Sun: described as the similar disparity between the two different individuals, so I think the whole family can be treated as the results.

53
00:19:52.800 --> 00:20:11.640
Xiangguo Sun: Of the influence you know, maybe in the initial stages to people are very different, and now they somehow get connected and then they try to impact each other and the best time going to become more and more similar so there's a saying goes, named.

54
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.560
Xiangguo Sun: The Birds fly together right.

55
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:26.760
Xiangguo Sun: that's actually saying that the end result of of the impacts from from different people which can make different people become more and more similar.

56
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:34.950
Xiangguo Sun: The confounding as trade that environment to force which can make in the new lead singer and they can annotate so.

57
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:45.990
Xiangguo Sun: First, today, you need to be familiar with all these concepts that's means in your funnel with them, maybe we can just a direct copy this sentence in the.

58
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:59.880
Xiangguo Sun: In your classroom and you just need to to make sure whether this statement is correct or around, so I think, maybe you will find this kind of question the often you know finally get down.

59
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:16.710
Xiangguo Sun: and other things about the relation between these three concepts know the confounding but influenced and the hub of failing and that, as we previously said the compounding can be treated it as the external force to make people.

60
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.320
Xiangguo Sun: become similar and that the influence a is actually.

61
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:30.120
Xiangguo Sun: built on the connection right, because if you don't have connections with other people, you cannot have other you cannot influence others.

62
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:44.820
Xiangguo Sun: And when you influence other or you'll be impacted by the other people your attitude, you know, become the the same guys you're become more and more similar so that's the similarities, the results of the.

63
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:57.960
Xiangguo Sun: influence and the same different pete but, since our people can add to the about each other and more similar than disconnected the ones, and we will we call this because it's.

64
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.130
Xiangguo Sun: Because they situation as the hall of fame.

65
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.490
Xiangguo Sun: So this is the cause and effect, and I think this features are important to remember.

66
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:10.890
Xiangguo Sun: and

67
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:19.890
Xiangguo Sun: This the opposite the continent from the nitrogen for that that thing this is very easy to understand, so I don't think either well our.

68
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:37.170
Xiangguo Sun: Existing our final exam and here you can see an example in the real life, talking about the influence Hama Hama failure and the confounding so basically a user need to know the difference between these three concept.

69
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:56.520
Xiangguo Sun: The influence is build on the connectivity right, so it is a small girlfriends influence other none none none a smoker France, because the and please note that the statement of the most important word in this in this sentence is a friend's.

70
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:08.100
Xiangguo Sun: A smoker cannot influence others which don't have any no social connection with them, because I don't know this guy's right so.

71
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:27.990
Xiangguo Sun: And this guy that's I mean, I cannot be influenced by by this guy but now these sentences, they are friends, so the France been to actually have some connections in their social life or in their daily life and the other friends, maybe some other relationships that can also.

72
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:35.550
Xiangguo Sun: Allow the influence of flow along this path of follow along this.

73
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:45.840
Xiangguo Sun: along this communication, for example, maybe some were famous popular guys he maybe she's like a smoking.

74
00:23:46.590 --> 00:24:04.440
Xiangguo Sun: And i'm at a standoff with him and then I will be impacted and maybe I will also like it, the smoky rises so let's talk about the influence and the key off of the influence the key point of influence is usually first.

75
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:16.020
Xiangguo Sun: build the connectivity between the individuals so that's, the most important thing about the influence so when you try to differentiate that influence.

76
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:23.070
Xiangguo Sun: or when you try to discriminate discriminate here that the influence homophobia and the combat the you need to know.

77
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:30.600
Xiangguo Sun: The key points about the influence is the productivity right, you need to build the relations between different individuals.

78
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:46.200
Xiangguo Sun: And that the hum affected tub the means to smoke should become friends why because the senior people are more likely to to be France than this meter people's so the home offending says.

79
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.240
Xiangguo Sun: The initial stage of the home of beloved means maybe we don't have any.

80
00:24:52.620 --> 00:25:11.520
Xiangguo Sun: relationship, whether we are similar and we meet each and sometimes we need spot absent and we find will be at where we are the same people and then with the Conference, so the homicide it tells about the process to connected.

81
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:23.820
Xiangguo Sun: The killer to create of the the relationship and that the confounding talk about the external environment right so that's mean and that the sentences.

82
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:32.340
Xiangguo Sun: claim that there are lots of places that people can spoke and a smoking is a tab on local culture, so in this sentence.

83
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:47.670
Xiangguo Sun: The most important word is a lot of places in the local storage and, as you can see the pluses and the local structure is accurate beyond the individual it's just the additional environment right.

84
00:25:48.420 --> 00:26:01.170
Xiangguo Sun: which can influence you so this three different parts of the difference between these three concepts and I think this the, the only important thing you need to know about this.

85
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.120
Xiangguo Sun: content.

86
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:17.190
Xiangguo Sun: The second question which other spin I promised them in a month or two around the first choice influence is a process by which, in the visual.

87
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:25.500
Xiangguo Sun: effects and now they're in the vehicle such that the flow when the influence individual becomes more similar to the influential feature.

88
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:43.350
Xiangguo Sun: and actually I think this correct and we talked about or willing to come about influence, just as a previous yourself, the most important thing is, you need to do the connectivity right so that means an individual as an individual and that the result is the constant learner.

89
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.930
Xiangguo Sun: And is the home of failing.

90
00:26:47.670 --> 00:27:07.080
Xiangguo Sun: Tell us about another thing it tells about the similar people are more likely to be connected, so the second choice at the home affiliate is a reserve in already similar individual yes, because for two different people are are not similar they cannot they cannot.

91
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:17.190
Xiangguo Sun: be connected right each other so that's not the home of at the hospital tell us about the process of building connected connectivity.

92
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:27.270
Xiangguo Sun: And the third choice, confounding is the environment if those under me are making do it was similar in that this is the sick, this thing sentence in.

93
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:43.950
Xiangguo Sun: Our lecture right, so this correctly so there's our business correct and the fourth choice, confounding for us is that is an internal factors that are dependent on inter individual interactive interactions.

94
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:50.490
Xiangguo Sun: And I think this around because is actually the external factor right, so this is.

95
00:27:51.720 --> 00:28:08.100
Xiangguo Sun: Not crowded, but please know that this sounds have another claim it says the confounding is dependent on intra individual interactions is it that's correct or is that crowd.

96
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.980
Xiangguo Sun: And I always and I don't think so because the because, just as previous.

97
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:36.120
Xiangguo Sun: Other previous example, you can see, the local culture can be treated as a cop out on the bread and the local tower can be treated as that external environment that will talk about that local couch it actually the group level.

98
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:49.500
Xiangguo Sun: The group level behaviors and it actually contain many individual people's, so I think it has no relationship between you know between the Indian middle level behavior right.

99
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.520
Xiangguo Sun: So, but this sentence, I think the main.

100
00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:03.540
Xiangguo Sun: Put that the most evident arrow in this sentence about the internal factor and things should be changed as the Asterix after.

101
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:23.670
Xiangguo Sun: The third classroom was the modularity and in our previous in last week's Torah we talked about the authenticity and I now show you, and now I don't show you any equation value that so that to me, but if you remember.

102
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:37.830
Xiangguo Sun: That or if you record that content carefully, you might remember that the also the territory is actually consists of two parts right if you.

103
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:48.660
Xiangguo Sun: If you're trying to record the authenticity equation in six awaits electric and then maybe yoga remember that but also activity consists of two parts, the first part is the expectation.

104
00:29:49.140 --> 00:30:01.170
Xiangguo Sun: And the second part is is the real order narrative right, so this is the second part is how to calculate the modularity and you can just directly refer to this.

105
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.510
Xiangguo Sun: equation.

106
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.470
Xiangguo Sun: to calculate the modularity and.

107
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:15.810
Xiangguo Sun: I know this equation seems complicated and it's hard to remember, so what should I do if.

108
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:38.580
Xiangguo Sun: We if there's a question, you can say is that, in your final exam and I think if if you are asked to calculate the modularity your final exam and the since you cannot take take the book right, and I think I might give you this equation.

109
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.250
Xiangguo Sun: I don't see it, maybe you know, maybe I will.

110
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:46.860
Xiangguo Sun: give you this equation.

111
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:56.460
Xiangguo Sun: A pendant on the real of the question and then maybe you can just refer to this question that calculated the the.

112
00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:09.360
Xiangguo Sun: Commodity so that's me in the first day you need to know how to calculate the modularity by the magic of his methods, you need to know the meaning of you know that you are.

113
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:24.660
Xiangguo Sun: In the trees have an edge right and that the end was the minister am you can stay there, and actually the number of agents right and the delta metric the metric would be how the cake of that was the makeup of that so you need to move that.

114
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:36.390
Xiangguo Sun: are true said hi, we were told, some equation will be provided in the year, but you just need to know that some equation, not all the questions.

115
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:58.500
Xiangguo Sun: Because you know some very similar but simple equation, maybe, maybe not be included in the question, but I, but I guess this question, I think it's too complicated and it's hard to remember, so I think it will be highly possible to you know to be provided in the classroom.

116
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:18.120
Xiangguo Sun: So you can just sit but but no matter how I think the most important things is the first need to know the meaning of each components right if you if you don't know the meaning, then even your provided with the equation, you cannot you you don't know how to get the answer.

117
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:29.100
Xiangguo Sun: So this graph actually have two types and lots of time and the right tab and I actually I also tell me the type in the.

118
00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:45.090
Xiangguo Sun: In the question right, and then you can see let's say there are two types of knows the left side is a one time and the right, the right side, is it the other type so that means you have to, and that.

119
00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.260
Xiangguo Sun: Much credit is our trade.

120
00:32:52.020 --> 00:33:01.320
Xiangguo Sun: refer to the first type and the second column refer to the second type and each line in the natural refer to.

121
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:27.750
Xiangguo Sun: The notes inconsistent with their index right so there's another 12345 if know to one you don't have the first time, the way we use one to indicate its type and if you use zero to integrate indicated the other types, so this is the amount of the to construct that the delta metric and.

122
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.810
Xiangguo Sun: The magic eight is just that the.

123
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:43.590
Xiangguo Sun: agent the battery, so it is very simple right, and then you just need to calculate the beta be the match will be according to the equation, and in order to calculate.

124
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:54.840
Xiangguo Sun: You also need the the factor D and it's the degree of actors, so, for example, the no one had different to so we ascend to hear right and.

125
00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:12.060
Xiangguo Sun: They just need to calculate this matchup and and I think this is very easy to to turn to to calculate tonight for them to transpose of the metric do is just that the line from that numbers and then you just need to calculate the product to offer them that's enough.

126
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.300
Xiangguo Sun: Maybe you have final exam maybe either also use this graph but there's some different.

127
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.910
Xiangguo Sun: values, for example, maybe, maybe of your remove this age.

128
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:36.840
Xiangguo Sun: or remote this age, if I remove the the angel we want to, we want to be five that means you just need to change the metrics a.

129
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:46.140
Xiangguo Sun: And you don't need to change the delta metric right, but you need to update that Dr D and also updated the value of air and then.

130
00:34:48.090 --> 00:35:00.240
Xiangguo Sun: follow this equation, to get the new answer so if you're if you're prepared for up for a final exam Maybe you can use this question to that's you be more familiar based on our team.

131
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:18.180
Xiangguo Sun: And the next question is powered by hogtied grafton this graph The other thing or the previous question so for the underwriter with it, but part of that graph which determines around and this question isn't more.

132
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.050
Xiangguo Sun: is easier than the previous question right because.

133
00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:32.010
Xiangguo Sun: The answer is just listed here see if you know how to calculate monitoring it and then you can get the answer for this cousin very easy.

134
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.600
Xiangguo Sun: This this cluster and talk about the.

135
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:51.270
Xiangguo Sun: The correlation, I think, and I think this is the most difficult part in the total course for the for the calculations.

136
00:35:51.990 --> 00:36:07.560
Xiangguo Sun: So if you can handle this calculation that's mean you will get done will handle all the other tech problems and out, and please remember that I also provide handle are a reference and.

137
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:32.310
Xiangguo Sun: we're ready to show you how to tackle that in detail in the piazza you can turn to our peers to download the PDF and they will find that the detail to calculate them, and I think, maybe the original equation might also be provided in the in the final exam, but the problem is this.

138
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:52.500
Xiangguo Sun: equation is a very abstract abstract I mean, for example, if you need maybe I will just give you this equation, but when you try to calculate this equation, you need to know how to calculate the each component right.

139
00:36:53.520 --> 00:37:03.390
Xiangguo Sun: So this is the details about that, and I think, maybe you just need to follow our previous slide in the piazza and then you will get the correct answer.

140
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:17.310
Xiangguo Sun: And also, please note that this cousin ask you to calculate the covariance, but we also have a normalized a version that covariance because the Pearson correlation right so when you.

141
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:37.710
Xiangguo Sun: conduct your your nose down, you need to tip to read it, the classic very carefully and make sure whether the question asked you to calculate the covariance or the normalize the conference, because both the answer my the exists in the choices.

142
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:48.180
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so this is the question sakes, I will also release that put the total answers that have quizzes the output visit toro.

143
00:37:50.160 --> 00:38:06.030
Xiangguo Sun: And that's, the question is there it's a very straightforward and which of the following around according to small world graph model if you are not familiar with that small world graph model Maybe you can refer to our.

144
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:19.170
Xiangguo Sun: With the same tutorial I think I think I told them in a way to see and week five tutorial so in order.

145
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:37.800
Xiangguo Sun: To further choice, out of that arm and that's roku is a high class terrain cannot be, at the same time, the small world and it's totally around because when you record the the process of generating small words, you will find we actually start from the blood taste the.

146
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:54.540
Xiangguo Sun: mishap has a high, but fixed across the inquiry ference and then we randomly replace some some edges and then what were generated the another a graph which can follow the distribution.

147
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.290
Xiangguo Sun: The power distribution or the small bro.

148
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:08.160
Xiangguo Sun: graph so Actually, I think that a natural is a high pastor and can actually be the same time as a small world.

149
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:16.770
Xiangguo Sun: And the second choice says it's more to provide insights and the interplay between clustering and the regular.

150
00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:26.010
Xiangguo Sun: In that case, and I think it's mostly he says a talk about how the generated small world and apparently is cracked.

151
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:35.250
Xiangguo Sun: The third choice in the small word modal a parameter controls randomness in a model and when big equal to 02 motors that play a record lattes.

152
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:45.990
Xiangguo Sun: and also the first choice this church process actually just derived from this model right, so you just need to return back to that amount of.

153
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:59.940
Xiangguo Sun: You don't need to know their details about this model, because when that in your final exam maybe we're just just doesn't need to know to be familiar with that maybe we maybe we just.

154
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.020
Xiangguo Sun: Maybe we just asked for you, you know the.

155
00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:25.920
Xiangguo Sun: The relation between the small world and the case, and maybe we'll ask for better we can generate the small world and how to generate a small world in the be maybe you will meet some some questions you need to answer the question.

156
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:37.110
Xiangguo Sun: To to tell you to tell us the method you know when when we asked you how to generate the small world you just need to tell you.

157
00:40:37.800 --> 00:41:00.450
Xiangguo Sun: We can't interest my word by by this model and this model said we first got with the stars from from from the lattes and we just replace that the edges and you just need to describe that the the overview of this model and then you will get the full marks, I think.

158
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:21.360
Xiangguo Sun: So that's means your final exam may be included this the some not the choices problem and some calculation problems and then maybe maybe it will be also means some you know statement, which means you need to make a statement about some some types of problems.

159
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:30.000
Xiangguo Sun: And this class and said recently, the following statements regarding influence modeling.

160
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.890
Xiangguo Sun: When it comes to the influence and modeling.

161
00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.120
Xiangguo Sun: I also want to ask you that when you.

162
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:47.340
Xiangguo Sun: When you said that the influence in the first two remember that it actually build out the connectivity right.

163
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:53.070
Xiangguo Sun: And then we also have a model name the linear model which can.

164
00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:07.920
Xiangguo Sun: describe the process of the flow winced about that that influence into network, so I introduced this modal in our last two weeks tutorial and I will.

165
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:16.050
Xiangguo Sun: tell you more details again later so basically These are four choices that seems.

166
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.210
Xiangguo Sun: All talk this seems all talk about program ballads and the.

167
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:29.310
Xiangguo Sun: linear search with model right okay so that's maybe we just need to record that and.

168
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:33.180
Xiangguo Sun: Okay i'll give you some.

169
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:44.220
Xiangguo Sun: You can see how about this model, so this is the linear says food model introducing our previous slides and.

170
00:42:46.260 --> 00:43:07.080
Xiangguo Sun: The model start from our initial nodes which had already been activated and then it started to try to influence his neighbors so for each neighbor maybe, for example, what the note to its need to evaluate all the influence.

171
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:30.150
Xiangguo Sun: He accepted from his neighbors and on the industry instagram there's only one neighbor have a way to just a week one so that's the way to can only be influenced by what you want, and the he has his own thresholds are points that are appointed eight but the influence we want to provide.

172
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:42.510
Xiangguo Sun: is only 4.5 is smaller than upon eight so that's mean in this stage in this stage that another way to cannot be impacted by may be by one.

173
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:56.010
Xiangguo Sun: But when we talk when we turn to the three we can find the dress code is a point seven and, though we weren't we weren't an impactful can provide the appointed eight to restore it so that's me with or it can be.

174
00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:09.660
Xiangguo Sun: influenced right but, but this graph this feature I think it's a little ambiguous, because if a leader you think that the note to just enable.

175
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:24.660
Xiangguo Sun: It just be impacted or influenced by is by one of his you know father's right, but actually the linear says the model is not talking about you know one.

176
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:39.930
Xiangguo Sun: parent is actually all his parents influence you actually need to to to calculate that the summation of all his parents are all his the activated parents influence, but this graph.

177
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:59.250
Xiangguo Sun: You know boss, we to and basically the, the only one parents, so this claim is not up of yours today shown in this part, but when we talk about that before we can say that we need to consider all his parents have asked me that we need to consider v3 and a beach.

178
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:09.420
Xiangguo Sun: And we need to calculate the summation of all his activated Father right, but sadly this graph has only one other.

179
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:21.900
Xiangguo Sun: Well, one parents being activated so just indicate that oh point one and compare them with the threats of before, but in your final exam maybe either tryna disbrow.

180
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:36.150
Xiangguo Sun: So that means you know final exam maybe sometimes you might assign both week, two and three are then you know are activated so that's time we'll consider before.

181
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:49.170
Xiangguo Sun: you'll need to first today, you need to first calculate the summation of what we three end of week be right, so that may cause the different results of this graph.

182
00:45:50.640 --> 00:46:08.700
Xiangguo Sun: So this is the linear model and later, we will also learn another modal talking valid information cascades which are very similar, which is very similar to the linear model and then we'll we'll talk about them later in details.

183
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:18.030
Xiangguo Sun: So now let's go back to the question person and see what they've had talking about the first choice than.

184
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:30.720
Xiangguo Sun: To model can be used him, other than a tweet influence apparently legit right, and the second choice, this model is this simple but effective model for moderating influence in southern Idaho yes apparently.

185
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:42.210
Xiangguo Sun: In which knows make decision knows make decisions based on the influence come coming from they're already activated neighborhoods and.

186
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:50.820
Xiangguo Sun: Maybe your final exam Maybe other change this sentence other said, our invasion those make the serum based on.

187
00:46:51.720 --> 00:47:04.140
Xiangguo Sun: That influence coming from one of his father of one of his parents, if I change the sentence, as this statements that mean this around right because you need to calculate all the.

188
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:18.270
Xiangguo Sun: influence from from from from all the activity neighbors with and actually if one knows his big is activated he can he can active others all the time.

189
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:33.720
Xiangguo Sun: Right see that's mean she has multiple time to actually others, but other than later, when we talk about the the information that if the information cascade mode or your we see the difference.

190
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:50.490
Xiangguo Sun: The third choice that is no the choices are rescued random a from the uniform distribution yeah interrupt between during the war and, yes, that is correct, so that means what that means, this process actually.

191
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:56.790
Xiangguo Sun: admit this process, it cannot be guaranteed to repeat it.

192
00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:06.120
Xiangguo Sun: With that, because the threshold is not actually fix it it's just a random value generated and.

193
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:18.150
Xiangguo Sun: This is the third choice and the first shot at time T own those that were active in the previous steps become.

194
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.190
Xiangguo Sun: inactive additive.

195
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:35.400
Xiangguo Sun: All knows that more active become inactive I think that's wrong because, just as our previous previous research, so if a notice until he can you know you can actually others all the time.

196
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:46.620
Xiangguo Sun: So I don't think this crowd and on windows or read them to meditate for time together child to the others time at the parenting that this is totally around.

197
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:57.600
Xiangguo Sun: OK, the next question I think it's about the regular taste and we also talked about work out taste the other way to fly tutorial I think.

198
00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:14.160
Xiangguo Sun: When you talk about book when it comes about when it comes to the record that he's doing it for to calculate to to remember you know the equation, you know to to to judge whether a pair from those should have an age.

199
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:23.820
Xiangguo Sun: You know the equation right the mean the Max and to find the distance between the node ids.

200
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:46.530
Xiangguo Sun: So this question said a regular activities degrees say equal to four and 10 nose, so this webinar is I think it's just the same as our lectures so with you and doesn't return for trouble extras and the to to to find which of the following is a correct the first the first claim on.

201
00:49:47.730 --> 00:50:00.240
Xiangguo Sun: A regular head is a special case of like your networks, where there is a multiple patents on how older his nose, I can add to one another.

202
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:10.470
Xiangguo Sun: I don't think it's correct because actually if we if you're a given the degree and then those number, you can already sure fixed.

203
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:23.520
Xiangguo Sun: Regular that hey so that's mean there's only one pouch on yeah and the second choice, there is an age connecting another one another, we we throw it and the alignments that that's a nice choice.

204
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.750
Xiangguo Sun: I think the most important thing is about.

205
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:42.000
Xiangguo Sun: it's about the the equation, you know Union for to take the minor between are not four minus one is equal history, and these are less than half of the half of the degree and.

206
00:50:42.930 --> 00:51:01.620
Xiangguo Sun: For this case you need to calculate a nine minute by one and two junior also you're also to Plaza wisdom was the total number right here that says calculate that and even you don't know the equation, you can just direct to get the answer via joy.

207
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:10.860
Xiangguo Sun: Instead of this graph and then you're fine but there's two nodes that are actually not about each other and.

208
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:25.830
Xiangguo Sun: The false choice in this regular that he knows that are connected to the previous four and following for unknown and totally around because the debrief with as I mean you just the can add to their premier to end the following two.

209
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:50.010
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so this tells me about an hour tm and because we you conducted this on a quiz actually you don't know the detail about it about this about this motor rain so that's me all your guys will get a full marks, no matter, no, no matter which choice your truth.

210
00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:57.960
Xiangguo Sun: But apparently you know families out your will neither gather this lucky things and.

211
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:10.590
Xiangguo Sun: The following our tier and procedure for the following graph assuming that the thresholds, not all the services are up on the fly and that, in the initial stage, the v3 is activated.

212
00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:17.970
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so in this initial stage, we celebrated and it asks.

213
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:35.880
Xiangguo Sun: Which of the following those will be activated at time one, so you just need to calculate one hop right OK, so the initial in the initial stage we threes activated and that's talking about sweet to in a way to.

214
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:50.970
Xiangguo Sun: Actually, we need to check both, we need to check with three before and the wi fi because all of them are the neighbors are afraid to, but in the initial stage before end of the fight are not.

215
00:52:51.570 --> 00:53:07.980
Xiangguo Sun: activated only referees activated so it doesn't mean that we to attend only receives or Point six, which is the larger than upon the fine so apparently to sort of be activated at a time one right.

216
00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:12.990
Xiangguo Sun: And how about who we for.

217
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:35.970
Xiangguo Sun: You know, we three we six wi fi there's three guys that can influence the way for, but in the initial stage, possibly six and a vote by an activated only research right, so he can provide upon three, which is less resist smaller that all quantified Okay, so he just.

218
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.340
Xiangguo Sun: and

219
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:42.360
Xiangguo Sun: How about we six.

220
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:49.920
Xiangguo Sun: also open up, for it is smaller than qualified right okay so that's mean.

221
00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.620
Xiangguo Sun: The credit answer is way too.

222
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.830
Xiangguo Sun: But I think this question has some a little tiny problem.

223
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:17.190
Xiangguo Sun: You know this theme of this out which of the following those will be activated as time one right, so how about know how about a changing the statement as a new statement for prism how about we said which.

224
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.410
Xiangguo Sun: Have the following knows.

225
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:26.850
Xiangguo Sun: This.

226
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:31.920
Time.

227
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:43.260
Xiangguo Sun: I think there's two statements are very similar know that the original statement said.

228
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:53.730
Xiangguo Sun: will be accurate right and the average new statement said which the following those are, or is it limited.

229
00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:00.120
Xiangguo Sun: How about not after time one Okay, so I think now that might be more accurate.

230
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.840
Xiangguo Sun: So if I choose to steam it as newest demand.

231
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.340
Xiangguo Sun: can tell me the credit answer.

232
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:16.590
Xiangguo Sun: Which of the following though oh I just you know which which nodes which nodes.

233
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:20.610
Xiangguo Sun: Are is activated out a tough one.

234
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.350
Xiangguo Sun: yeah Thank you Joe.

235
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:50.790
Xiangguo Sun: it's after two nodes right and that's entry correspond to our previous question here, you know this question and sell it at 20 on over it with the previous one, become inactive so it's all around why, because if I noticed it when he will be activate all of the core of the.

236
00:55:52.230 --> 00:56:06.270
Xiangguo Sun: The process, so if we change this statement here, maybe in an Avatar one only a way for will be activated and the reason is already activated so you have a fan to knows.

237
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.290
Xiangguo Sun: But apparently this person only have not only how one knows right.

238
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.860
Xiangguo Sun: History and that we fought.

239
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:37.590
Xiangguo Sun: So I don't I don't want to change the statement that and maybe after that you will be you look at it further and deeper understand understanding about this person, and this is my first suggestion to change this, the month right and my second suggestion.

240
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:53.340
Xiangguo Sun: I encourage you to continue this process until all the nodes have been activated or into the remote stock, so this is my homework for for you guys and and I are you.

241
00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.020
Xiangguo Sun: right here.

242
00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.220
Xiangguo Sun: So this my first assess.

243
00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:01.800
Xiangguo Sun: distance.

244
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:14.520
Xiangguo Sun: If you want, if you guys are now preparing for the final exam and you for your you know aggressive for for opportunity that the higher score.

245
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.750
Xiangguo Sun: is my first my second son is.

246
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.820
Xiangguo Sun: You can continue.

247
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.920
Xiangguo Sun: The process.

248
00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.350
Xiangguo Sun: model stops.

249
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:57.240
Xiangguo Sun: This is my suggestion here.

250
00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:20.010
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so if you guys are interested in is to problem Maybe you can just to you know conduct your own custom and post your answer in your piazza and looking forward to your answers Okay, so this person it's a very interesting and I think in our final exams.

251
00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:22.110
Xiangguo Sun: This graph.

252
00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:41.670
Xiangguo Sun: The difficulty of this graph is enough so you'll want to meet any other graph which we are getting more complicated than this, I think this probably is totally complicated and it's the upper bound down around the of the the difficulty.

253
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:57.150
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so this graph, and this is the the original constantly your lecture about the linear model and, as you can see, the most important thing is, we need to calculate the summation of all the accolades and neighbors here.

254
00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:12.630
Xiangguo Sun: Does does reply to some students question shouldn't you answer be shouldn't your answer be we three and and we too yeah I just as I say, you know.

255
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.360
Xiangguo Sun: The first person to answer is.

256
00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:17.190
Xiangguo Sun: No.

257
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:23.370
Xiangguo Sun: Oh, you said oh yeah yes, she you know some students.

258
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:32.580
Xiangguo Sun: argue about our argue this statement so i'd say that that that does think it is.

259
00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:47.310
Xiangguo Sun: Just revisit this question again, you know, in the first initial stage, only v3 is accurate right okay so we'll be right, basically here Okay, so in the.

260
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:52.350
Xiangguo Sun: In the second stage, I mean at time the one.

261
00:59:53.940 --> 01:00:07.050
Xiangguo Sun: Apparently only way for will be activated so after time one we how we three and we for activated right.

262
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:14.610
Xiangguo Sun: But that's not the most most difficult part the most difficult the most difficult part is.

263
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.800
Xiangguo Sun: How about.

264
01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:23.040
Xiangguo Sun: Now what's the theme was that stays after time to.

265
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:29.100
Xiangguo Sun: You know, when we talk about the third stage I mean.

266
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:40.980
Xiangguo Sun: The date, I mean the the same the status after time time one time to that's a mentor with three and before they are already activated.

267
01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:50.160
Xiangguo Sun: Right so in the initial stage will chat will be three you actually only need to consider with three because.

268
01:00:50.700 --> 01:01:08.940
Xiangguo Sun: into an initial stage stage with four and with this idea, not acted activated but after time we went before has already been activated and so, in the next stage, and what we'll chat a little bit with me to you actually to consider both of these three and four.

269
01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:33.330
Xiangguo Sun: So you need to calculate the summation of all point six and 0.20 yeah yeah I know I, yes, I know you're not in it sorry in this question, you know the history and the week with their boss activated but now i'm now i'm talking and I just you know.

270
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:51.930
Xiangguo Sun: let's assume that that's assume you're not in the in the town of one that has some with what before is activated you know that's just ignore the value of this age okay yeah that's just ignore that that amount of days that assume that the.

271
01:01:53.340 --> 01:02:10.440
Xiangguo Sun: atom one before it had already been activated and then in another stage will talk about the which who you need to consider before before the end of this way so that's the difference, know that the initial stage.

272
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:21.030
Xiangguo Sun: What we'll talk about the history, you only consider when we talk about vitriolic and stuff history, but in the future we revisit them we to.

273
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:35.910
Xiangguo Sun: Do you need to change your you know actually the neighbors so that may be the problem, but apparently for for this statement that the crackdowns is the week three individual I just made a mistake sorry about that Okay, so thank you for the month.

274
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:47.250
Xiangguo Sun: that's called rebel tongue, one reason, and we need on part time and yeah yeah okay so let's continue about that.

275
01:02:48.870 --> 01:03:05.730
Xiangguo Sun: This is the so the code of the office model, but I think that's not important, because you are not asked to you know implemented this model right you don't need to know the basic idea but small This, I think, if you can repeat the process.

276
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.810
Xiangguo Sun: Before this graph you know you just that.

277
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:27.390
Xiangguo Sun: To draw the picture like this step one step two step three step four know for this graph if we can continue this process and that that means, this is the code you'll already be familiar with that, and you just need to it's often or not important.

278
01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:29.730
Okay.

279
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.520
Xiangguo Sun: So.

280
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:48.210
Xiangguo Sun: justin we just talked about the homophobic I will talk about the influence and now we've come to the home of La so here are some mother to calculate the, the home of failing marrying.

281
01:03:48.720 --> 01:04:00.000
Xiangguo Sun: But I don't think it's very important that you just need to be familiar with that and, for example, we just need to know what's the meaning of the age that's about the holiday Linda is defined as this one okay that's enough.

282
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:07.080
Xiangguo Sun: And what's worse than that wasn't enough for all the new attributes you just need to know this concept another thing that stuff.

283
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.650
Xiangguo Sun: So this is the knowledge very important and the haemophilia, just as the.

284
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:25.620
Xiangguo Sun: previous day is it started from some similar knows right and and the way clay, now that the singer node can be connected in a field trip, because the because the following the homophobic.

285
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:41.340
Xiangguo Sun: So that's means the home affiliate model is actually you know gets crazy describe the process now it's selecting single node and get get connected between them, for example, this minister so it's just a random number and to.

286
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.040
Xiangguo Sun: To to to marry that.

287
01:04:45.210 --> 01:05:02.550
Xiangguo Sun: to compare with the similarity between this node because node to node most similar other two nodes more likely to be connected right, so this is the probability are and the to compare with their similarity and if.

288
01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:13.620
Xiangguo Sun: If if the heat and then we just sit out these two nodes and connected with each other to add the edge to the total etc so that's very simple model.

289
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:25.080
Xiangguo Sun: And then we talked about the inflammation disillusion when we talk about the information diffusion you just need to know it's our tree talking about it, that the.

290
01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:40.710
Xiangguo Sun: Time to process that information start from from one node and then pick go go along a path and then to to the other nodes so that just a simple process, but we have, I think we have another.

291
01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.310
Xiangguo Sun: Now that the to calculate them later, and I think i've told them that.

292
01:05:48.450 --> 01:06:00.570
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so this is all important thing being castaways tutorial and then we talked about the heart behavior and also it's also very you know social.

293
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:11.880
Xiangguo Sun: social media sociological concept and we just need to do was to her behavior was the candidate with that and that's enough, we don't you want me to any.

294
01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:25.080
Xiangguo Sun: You know calculation problem and you just need to be familiar with that, but I strongly recommend you to be familiar with the information cascade because when we talk about inflammation cascade.

295
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:39.660
Xiangguo Sun: Your will meet our model which very similar to our previous know linear model so that's just directly go to the employment information cascade.

296
01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:52.140
Xiangguo Sun: X Ray I think that information candidate I think it's there's just the same on the same meaning to the information diffusion right, because just talking about the structure of information flowing.

297
01:06:53.280 --> 01:07:04.350
Xiangguo Sun: So to describe the information cascade that we've developed for the independent cascade model with sugar for the ICM and I.

298
01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:10.410
Xiangguo Sun: And please know that the difference between the ICM and our previous method, because.

299
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:12.330
Xiangguo Sun: We might.

300
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.380
Xiangguo Sun: With because in some problems.

301
01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:20.100
Xiangguo Sun: In the in the front exam maybe you will.

302
01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:38.760
Xiangguo Sun: Come to maybe you will see this to aggregate together, you know in one classroom so doesn't mean maybe you will be confused about it there's two different multiple if you're not familiar with the difference, but all of them, so what's the difference of the ICM model.

303
01:07:42.240 --> 01:08:01.680
Xiangguo Sun: Ever written a number of young traders on linear regression model we stand when you talk about one Petits note, you need to calculate all his neighbors which have already been activated right, but for the independent Quasimodo you don't need to calculate all his neighbors.

304
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:15.840
Xiangguo Sun: that's the one difference and other difference are I prepare yourself for the linear model if one node is activated he can activity others all the time.

305
01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:26.370
Xiangguo Sun: And that's the reason why I previously leave this homework to you because because I want you why I live with this, the.

306
01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:48.030
Xiangguo Sun: Second, student to you because I want you guys, to know that if a waster it will be three is activated he can activity others or time and if we for this activity is also active which into our time one time two times three right Okay, but when we talk about.

307
01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:52.140
Xiangguo Sun: This model we talk about indeed and the capital model.

308
01:08:53.220 --> 01:09:01.890
Xiangguo Sun: Each node only have one chance to educate others, so that means that no one can activate which will be three.

309
01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:18.510
Xiangguo Sun: And then he can get the result Institute, but after step two we went to not know influence our anymore, so he becomes activated but he also become unseen or he has become you know you know death.

310
01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:30.630
Xiangguo Sun: that's the second difference about it's two different models so that's very, very busy take an overview of this more often this algorithm and we can say.

311
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:43.440
Xiangguo Sun: The previous setting are very similar travel to the linear therapy model, the only difference is about this one, you know he firstly generate a random number.

312
01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:55.620
Xiangguo Sun: The purpose of generating a random number is our trade for the probability programming right, so this program is a predefined and we just a.

313
01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:11.340
Xiangguo Sun: which I define you know the probability of whether these notes can be activated if there's no to can be activated we just added this know to the ultimate in the activity itself, but please note that this activity itself is a I it's not a.

314
01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:23.760
Xiangguo Sun: You know, a isn't it's not a I mind at one is API so that the meaning of Ai is the activated and knows during step it.

315
01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:36.330
Xiangguo Sun: So that's means alden activity knows the Ai can activate others in the next in the next step right, but all the nose in previous Ai.

316
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:51.390
Xiangguo Sun: cannot activity others anymore, you know, after this step, so if I should have money Ai you know eight to eight in one a two a three or correspond to the corresponding our States.

317
01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:05.370
Xiangguo Sun: So this graph I think it's similar to the previous graph that's the only different things you know in our previous grab we're going to keep you that starts with the operational but.

318
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:27.540
Xiangguo Sun: describe having those strategies this graph actually had just done, that age weight off of this, you know in this graph you know that is open the file and open to this is the age of value right yeah this is divided will be provided, but you know, this is just a random loud, it was.

319
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:36.600
Xiangguo Sun: So arbitrary, you cannot make sure they're all the same right and so that's the only you know.

320
01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:44.160
Xiangguo Sun: And that that's a very similar to our previous to the danger threat model because the linear therapeutic.

321
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:57.510
Xiangguo Sun: That that's usually random select different from from from zero to one, but we were giving you that that's right right and for the indie Panda and the cascading model.

322
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:24.660
Xiangguo Sun: The the value is the probability, and that means you also need to random some that to generate some random value to to to make the to make that the probability programming and that must mean this plus this model cannot can also a character can neither be guaranteed to repeat.

323
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:44.880
Xiangguo Sun: Each time, because you know it, it in the sense that maybe it generates the Middle East oakland for but we repeat this program maybe emerging another different values right, so the only thing we can make sure is that.

324
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:55.860
Xiangguo Sun: The happen the larger value means the larger probability that means this an agent might be more likely to be selected.

325
01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:11.940
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so that means the age range pretty presented influence probability right Okay, so I think we're arresting past and just have some break we'll come back about a few minutes later okay.

326
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:22.170
Xiangguo Sun: chiffon propose a question here Okay, and I will come back to answer a question later.

327
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:41.370
Xiangguo Sun: hear me now.

328
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.190
Xiangguo Sun: Okay.

329
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.090
Xiangguo Sun: i'm ready.

330
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:50.130
Are.

331
01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.550
Xiangguo Sun: You are you guys also.

332
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:56.100
Xiangguo Sun: Yes to me.

333
01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:00.300
Xiangguo Sun: hey guys a voice.

334
01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:05.790
Xiangguo Sun: it's time that's come back okay okay good Thank you.

335
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:13.230
Xiangguo Sun: Thank you good Okay, so now let's try to answer some problem propose very skilled and success now.

336
01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:15.270
Xiangguo Sun: that's.

337
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.340
Xiangguo Sun: The first problem.

338
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:38.760
Xiangguo Sun: As provide some sure it says in the independent model if we weren't as able to act in a bottle which you anniversary we are we to individual people yeah it's totally and it will be both activated.

339
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.220
Xiangguo Sun: Oh, I also know that.

340
01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:47.910
Xiangguo Sun: You know, a future students not attend and this tutorial.

341
01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:54.840
Xiangguo Sun: Might not how I might not understand the question you know.

342
01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.070
Xiangguo Sun: If they just watch the recording.

343
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.020
Xiangguo Sun: Because.

344
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:05.940
Xiangguo Sun: I think, was it is a cousin are very, very important so.

345
01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:11.970
Xiangguo Sun: i'm just going to copy this question on this slide and the allocated to.

346
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:28.590
Xiangguo Sun: The new student, you know some some some students might not attend today's lecture maybe this is better watch the video, and if they watch the video they cannot see our chatting box so we're going to probably the problem.

347
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:34.080
Xiangguo Sun: So this gave me some time to add a new on tonight's here.

348
01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:01.020
Xiangguo Sun: yeah Thank you.

349
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:03.510
Xiangguo Sun: sure.

350
01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:12.720
Xiangguo Sun: copy this picture to the slide because the word include your name here Would you mind me doing that.

351
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:19.950
Xiangguo Sun: And how to say that you guys are very.

352
01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:27.420
Xiangguo Sun: very, very smart, because today you're proposing any important question, I think, will be very important.

353
01:23:28.650 --> 01:23:30.870
Xiangguo Sun: Yes, thank you for your.

354
01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:33.930
Xiangguo Sun: You know your.

355
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:36.900
Xiangguo Sun: You can assume activated.

356
01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:42.480
Xiangguo Sun: So this issue okay not going to cover this tradition.

357
01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:44.010
Okay.

358
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:47.850
Xiangguo Sun: How about this one.

359
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:58.020
Xiangguo Sun: Okay Okay, so please give him some time to to organize them okay that's just answer this question, one by one.

360
01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.370
Xiangguo Sun: The first question.

361
01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:14.280
Xiangguo Sun: The first question, you can refer to our lecture you know and that's that's me find the content in the luxury.

362
01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:19.230
Xiangguo Sun: I sting is it exists in yeah yeah.

363
01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:28.530
Xiangguo Sun: And as you can say this is that accurate description of the independent the customer model right, and please know that in South.

364
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:40.770
Xiangguo Sun: node activated at time T has one chance at time T plus one to active, it is neighbors you know the neighbors not neighbor.

365
01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:53.910
Xiangguo Sun: So that's me it had one chance to activate all his neighbors so that means you know in this stage the random battery it's just a you know smaller that open the fight, but if we.

366
01:24:54.420 --> 01:25:06.720
Xiangguo Sun: Do before we luckily I just generated up a new random but glad it wasn't meant to be on six that means in the start to both of each and every three you know, should it be.

367
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:18.240
Xiangguo Sun: activated or story, you know i'm sorry that the aggregation says the random letters should be smaller than the probabilities and then it will be automated yeah so.

368
01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:33.000
Xiangguo Sun: that's assuming that in the other repayment maybe we generated all point oh Point five instead of all point nine that's mean both will be through and he will be activated.

369
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.150
Xiangguo Sun: And I can hear this, the first question Okay, and I see our.

370
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.070
Xiangguo Sun: last day talking about.

371
01:25:47.160 --> 01:26:03.930
Xiangguo Sun: Will and our question is here they don't have fast food or the hell random Internet, this is a threat to the talking about a linear pricing model it's talking about the value of nodes.

372
01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:13.050
Xiangguo Sun: You know the linear linear model we actually have two kinds of values than me.

373
01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:25.500
Xiangguo Sun: but rather how to kind of the first battle is the age of it, you know, it is about this age matter is not the probability it just that the age weight, or you can say it's just that the.

374
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:39.780
Xiangguo Sun: The fraction of the total the total influence right so it's just the influence, but the open eight is such as that the thread food and we just come here whether this.

375
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:53.730
Xiangguo Sun: influence is larger than a certitude okay it doesn't have the you know the probability things, but in the individual value in the sacrament, we can say.

376
01:26:55.770 --> 01:26:56.790
Xiangguo Sun: We can see.

377
01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:01.140
Xiangguo Sun: We don't have the 30th right.

378
01:27:03.090 --> 01:27:13.320
Xiangguo Sun: But you can also treat this possibility, as some somehow very soon, because we always compare the generous divided, to the corresponding know as well.

379
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:29.130
Xiangguo Sun: that the different thing is the general notion of be smaller than the edge and then you can see, this know to add to the others, but in the Lunar surface model, if I remember right it says i'm sorry there's another vendor.

380
01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:43.500
Xiangguo Sun: yeah you can see, the total you know some major should be larger than the slow slow down, you can see, it should actually others so that's the third different thing that that the only difference in.

381
01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.780
Xiangguo Sun: Another classroom.

382
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:49.740
Xiangguo Sun: Okay let's go back to the.

383
01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:54.390
Xiangguo Sun: newness.

384
01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.020
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, another question.

385
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:07.200
Xiangguo Sun: And if we can enter basically our boss activity by we weren't.

386
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:08.610
Xiangguo Sun: We.

387
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:15.000
Xiangguo Sun: were not alone i'm sorry.

388
01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:17.610
Xiangguo Sun: Not.

389
01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:25.020
Xiangguo Sun: use it in for week two and the week three.

390
01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.590
Xiangguo Sun: balls activated but we weren't okay.

391
01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.020
Xiangguo Sun: Leave forced.

392
01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.930
Xiangguo Sun: By we won't be frustrated.

393
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:37.620
Xiangguo Sun: i'm not sure what they're talking about.

394
01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:40.920
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, you said before serving food.

395
01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:46.230
Xiangguo Sun: With her has no food in the independent testimonial we're not.

396
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:50.340
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, you know.

397
01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:52.920
Xiangguo Sun: You know.

398
01:28:56.370 --> 01:29:13.410
Xiangguo Sun: john how with john jolly this person I think may not clear, but I think this President is a very important you know because it actually talking about one important thing you know the man in the middle of an independent has the cascading model, why we call that independent.

399
01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:25.680
Xiangguo Sun: What he called an independent, you know, for example, maybe that let's just ignore this rather than later okay so maybe in in the second step.

400
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:36.480
Xiangguo Sun: We to innovate they're both activates okay so Then we come to step three and we need to talk with me to come out before.

401
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:54.150
Xiangguo Sun: So how to compare before you know in our previous linear serves food which you just need to calculate the summation of all the way through, because we took with their post activated right now we come to independent customer model.

402
01:29:55.830 --> 01:30:00.930
Xiangguo Sun: Shall we do we need to calculate the summation of way to an MP3.

403
01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:26.010
Xiangguo Sun: See ya find said no, yes, this is a correct answer we can never calculated the summation why we cannot calculate the summation because this model is the independent model, the independent means we to the independent means that the who can directly.

404
01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:39.810
Xiangguo Sun: decide before state and the v3 can also directly decide before think vr to independent tasks, so you don't need to calculate the summation that means.

405
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:50.130
Xiangguo Sun: If we chew and refer a boat, or if a way to end with your boss activated in the second step when we come to the third step when we come to be for you just need to.

406
01:30:50.880 --> 01:31:06.120
Xiangguo Sun: First, consider this path, I mean we to 234 and two tickets to evaluate them better way for can be activated by virtue if we for can be activated done before, is activated.

407
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:23.700
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, and then you can come to this path v3 to before and you consider bother with with three can add to that before if we if we will return activity that done it activated so that means at least one has success.

408
01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.160
Xiangguo Sun: The V4 can be activated.

409
01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:36.210
Xiangguo Sun: that's the meaning why we call it the independent because they're not you know they're not correlated and I hope I hope it.

410
01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:44.490
Xiangguo Sun: makes clear, your confusion and other questions here let's just go back to the.

411
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:47.370
Xiangguo Sun: CMO.

412
01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:51.780
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so, so this is the second and then of course instead.

413
01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:07.890
Xiangguo Sun: According to the lecture the biggest difference between linear says komodo and the independent has the model is the APP to the time.

414
01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:24.030
Xiangguo Sun: And though the calcium can act to add another time, one more time to time through, yes, but I see i'm just can't until except node at time than a year, a specific time and only one shows.

415
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:47.460
Xiangguo Sun: If you're missing, this time, you can never actually others a little tree Okay, in terms of natural a node has been already activated it should have remained at the state, yes, so what's the meaning for out here once one node as our nose at one time two times three.

416
01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:53.400
Xiangguo Sun: This concern this very, very advanced.

417
01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:16.620
Xiangguo Sun: Actually, I cannot give a very comprehensive cancer, but I just need to provide some suggestion or some you know some shallow understanding for me Okay, so you know that out here and ICM can be actually treated as two basic patterns in our real life.

418
01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:26.250
Xiangguo Sun: That doesn't consider a situation if one person want to promote his production okay.

419
01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.820
Xiangguo Sun: Do you think he just.

420
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:31.680
Xiangguo Sun: retired his.

421
01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:42.030
Xiangguo Sun: advertisement for one time I don't think so because he can tell his friends today, and he tells his friend and other day.

422
01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:56.460
Xiangguo Sun: And he will just continue telling others for for to to promoting these products right, so I think this is a very similar or or you can see, this process that can be modeled by the by the our GM model.

423
01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:09.690
Xiangguo Sun: By the for the ICM model I think it's actually focused on the folks on the receiver you know the lts I think the folks on the Sander.

424
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:22.710
Xiangguo Sun: It focused on me who want to promote my promote my production, so I just you know, keeping you know telling our friend today another day another day right.

425
01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:36.480
Xiangguo Sun: But when you talk about the ic model I think it's been more know hey pay more attention on the receiver So can I be affected by other people's.

426
01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:43.770
Xiangguo Sun: If one person at a felony and if the success, but then I will be you know other be.

427
01:34:44.280 --> 01:35:00.900
Xiangguo Sun: assaulted right so that's enough, so I think that's the difference between or the real word meaning of about the out here, and as them but i'm not sure whether my answer is, you know, is totally actress but it's just you know, really.

428
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:08.040
Xiangguo Sun: Comprehensive understanding shallow shallow understanding, but I encourage you to to.

429
01:35:09.150 --> 01:35:16.050
Xiangguo Sun: To to research, this topics further and maybe you will find a more deeper understanding and the solutions.

430
01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:26.220
Xiangguo Sun: Thank you for the question, I think that this person is very good, thank you, thank you alicia another question ah OK, you guys are very.

431
01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:30.900
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, good good so they keep asking the question okay.

432
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:45.900
Xiangguo Sun: I think it's a little hard for me to hold on this on a session Okay, you might try iceberg, the chatroom you might you're not trying as brother shattered coghlan upload.

433
01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:53.490
Xiangguo Sun: Can I can I find that attractive old if I just did a quick Eva it says the enclave.

434
01:35:54.540 --> 01:36:02.700
Xiangguo Sun: asking us some must, it must cream frozen different might be, because my mama I didn't show more important things, but my screen.

435
01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:18.840
Xiangguo Sun: i'm curious why that algorithm is called linear model is it simple because the criteria is an altimeter then as a linear form Okay, this is also perfect very good.

436
01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:29.550
Xiangguo Sun: Customer, thank you for this, because in that, and I think you know you'll need to send yourself, because today, you answer to my question, I think that will be helpful.

437
01:36:30.210 --> 01:36:42.930
Xiangguo Sun: For other students were not attend attending today's on a tutorial okay let's just show up every day explanation about the leaner things, so why don't we call that a leaner okay.

438
01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.370
Xiangguo Sun: Before that, I just want to know.

439
01:36:53.550 --> 01:37:04.320
Xiangguo Sun: You know, just as a previous that you know for the linear stressful model, we need to compare the summation and the and the.

440
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:13.710
Xiangguo Sun: And the dreadful right, so we just need to calculate the estimation, and I personally think I personally think.

441
01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:22.350
Xiangguo Sun: that the name leaner is correlated with the summation because in.

442
01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:34.770
Xiangguo Sun: machine learning or data mining will your will sink money you know similar of farmers and we will require that the linear you know, for example, would be two months into a.

443
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:46.830
Xiangguo Sun: multiply by w class by be and we call those the gender relations right and that this thing is just a we calculate the.

444
01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.030
Xiangguo Sun: summation of the of the.

445
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:57.510
Xiangguo Sun: Age weight and the actually you can say is, you can see.

446
01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:07.560
Xiangguo Sun: In the real world, maybe the way to have some information than the research, maybe have some information so actually it can be organized and electric here.

447
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:19.350
Xiangguo Sun: And now we just you know in this lecture we just simply considered that influence right will be considered the summation of a REACH of the.

448
01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:31.410
Xiangguo Sun: The weight of this age and the weight of the of the sad part that imagine the real world situation is, is it possible to just simply considered the influence.

449
01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:37.980
Xiangguo Sun: I think we should also consider Boston in through us and the in the information itself.

450
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:53.730
Xiangguo Sun: So actually in the real world situation you actually need to tell the information on all the content, I mean the content of will be true, and then you tell me how much it can provide or either can influence the next knows.

451
01:38:55.020 --> 01:39:12.240
Xiangguo Sun: Right so maybe we can say the 20% of the information can be flow from the from from from way to to before or maybe 20% of them information is useful for before.

452
01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:24.510
Xiangguo Sun: So actually in a real water station you just need to calculate the multiplication of this age value and the know the information, but apparently in this graph we don't.

453
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:36.150
Xiangguo Sun: We don't stop the plan is the any not enough, we know the information here, so this Justice said the summation of Omega.

454
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:48.600
Xiangguo Sun: But, but in the real life, I think we actually need to take the summation of Omega magic side by the corresponding those information, so I think that's amazing well we call that that the linear sounds good.

455
01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:56.340
Xiangguo Sun: But this is just my personal understanding okay it's, not that I don't think whether it is the.

456
01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.050
Xiangguo Sun: Answer things about that.

457
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:05.040
Xiangguo Sun: Data TV has my question.

458
01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:10.560
Xiangguo Sun: let's take some time okay nevermind how.

459
01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:14.010
Xiangguo Sun: This enough in both cases.

460
01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:17.250
Xiangguo Sun: The note will activate.

461
01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:26.910
Xiangguo Sun: Is rescued value randomly generated properly valid is that, then he can combine at value.

462
01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:41.610
Xiangguo Sun: shall be hard right, I think, a month pronounces right, you said, the value should be less than as well, but I think that's not correct in our in the.

463
01:40:43.320 --> 01:41:08.670
Xiangguo Sun: In the in the independent model, a model that gender randomly generated vanish to be smaller than the probability or than the edible right, but in the linear model, we can say is should be sorry not this is to be larger than good larger or equivalent to the.

464
01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:12.420
Xiangguo Sun: So I think the other thing.

465
01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:20.100
Xiangguo Sun: let's go back to to to the question yeah.

466
01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:28.170
Xiangguo Sun: Think about information by.

467
01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:43.860
Xiangguo Sun: Under the influence some notes can get information so any of their parents or the Catholic influence we have some influence on paper in pounds.

468
01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:59.520
Xiangguo Sun: Yes, they're talking right, and I think you're talking about the dinner very good information why because it leaders this information with that right, thank you bye dad.

469
01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:02.910
Xiangguo Sun: that's very okay good.

470
01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:04.650
Xiangguo Sun: I think I.

471
01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:08.670
Xiangguo Sun: Think, so no more cancer right Thank you guys.

472
01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:12.420
Xiangguo Sun: And i'm just going to pester this cosmic yeah.

473
01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.160
Xiangguo Sun: So.

474
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:23.250
Xiangguo Sun: If a student, if you are not attending this on a tutorial you are now watching this video.

475
01:42:24.330 --> 01:42:25.140
Xiangguo Sun: Here are some.

476
01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:30.210
Xiangguo Sun: informative question proposal dollar student today and I just to.

477
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:38.340
Xiangguo Sun: Give the answer to them, so you just need to go back to the video and watch them OK let's continue okay.

478
01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.280
Xiangguo Sun: With talk about the Indian handed consumer model.

479
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:55.800
Xiangguo Sun: And this this summary of the independent model and for the summary, I think the most important things you need to make it clear, the difference between the independent Quasimodo and the linear model.

480
01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:13.560
Xiangguo Sun: Previously, I take I found at the data three differences The first one is that the linen service model can activate other no other knows all the time, you know the.

481
01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:27.420
Xiangguo Sun: But the independent the customer them each activity and modal just had one chance to influence others, this one different seven different this linear model should be compared with.

482
01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:36.900
Xiangguo Sun: Some Asian right that the summation ended up threshold if that I just submitted larger than the surface, it can be.

483
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:44.850
Xiangguo Sun: The tiger, to know that can be automated but differently in the independent that's the model we calculate.

484
01:43:46.410 --> 01:44:01.230
Xiangguo Sun: The profanity we compare it with the random and then that the random ungenerous the value and the best possibility, if it is smaller than the probability, we can see our there's no can act with the other knows that the second difference.

485
01:44:02.370 --> 01:44:07.710
Xiangguo Sun: The difference, I think it's the name, you know the linnean the linear.

486
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:16.620
Xiangguo Sun: model is talking about the summation of all he's a neighbor all his accolades and neighbors but the independent model.

487
01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:33.420
Xiangguo Sun: You just need to know just a stressful one had a snow, you know, maybe it's camp, he has multiple activating neighbors but only but other than one neighbor can activate the tide is no then this know that can be activated.

488
01:44:34.590 --> 01:44:36.390
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so it is things.

489
01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:38.670
Xiangguo Sun: Here okay good.

490
01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.410
Xiangguo Sun: Today, just to share with you can see the chat.

491
01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:48.510
Xiangguo Sun: to share.

492
01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:56.100
Xiangguo Sun: This is the caption contest to open that.

493
01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:58.200
Xiangguo Sun: Oh, he does done.

494
01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:03.600
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, thank you, thank you for for this situation okay.

495
01:45:05.250 --> 01:45:20.490
Xiangguo Sun: This is the different model, and I think that's the very this true model, I think it will be definitely exerting our final exam and the more time they might be come together in automated so it's very important to make the difference.

496
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:28.200
Xiangguo Sun: OK, so the NUTS things I think will be very easy and then maybe not you know very.

497
01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.290
Xiangguo Sun: Just to relax about.

498
01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:49.470
Xiangguo Sun: The next book content this about the most influential set so how to I think you just need to be familiar with some concept, though, so how to find the most influential said let's say.

499
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:55.890
Xiangguo Sun: let's say if, in the very nature stage we don't know which guys should be.

500
01:45:56.970 --> 01:45:58.110
Xiangguo Sun: should be activated.

501
01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:04.110
Xiangguo Sun: Maybe we just randomly select some some some of those for them, maybe you just select.

502
01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:06.570
Xiangguo Sun: select.

503
01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:09.510
Xiangguo Sun: A mid.

504
01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:26.280
Xiangguo Sun: Mid mid mid they are initially are activated so as we can say through the analyzes of the linear logical model and independent the customer model we can find that even in the interim those different.

505
01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:51.840
Xiangguo Sun: you'll also get different publication process right so that means not all the know not all those can be activated in the end, but it's highly correlated that with your with your in the initial activity and others, so we want to find this note that can make the influence.

506
01:46:53.130 --> 01:46:56.160
Xiangguo Sun: maximums to in order to influence.

507
01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:09.630
Xiangguo Sun: Ah, many either knows, you know as many as possible, so the here we come to to to to to this person does the how to find the initial set.

508
01:47:10.170 --> 01:47:26.580
Xiangguo Sun: This problem is very meaningful in our real life, for example, if I are produced some productions, if I want to promote to the title people, but I have limited money you know, maybe I only have $100 to how to fully.

509
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:39.330
Xiangguo Sun: utilize what happened to her daughters to make my promoting no more most influential to influence as many as possible people here.

510
01:47:40.230 --> 01:47:58.980
Xiangguo Sun: So that I mean I need to carefully selected some initial knows initial people to influence them to make sure if you're activated and then maybe they can be they can actually others but but by themselves so that's the difference that's the basic problem of this slide.

511
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.580
Xiangguo Sun: And here, here we also provide some some some concepts.

512
01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:11.130
Xiangguo Sun: This function F test them, meaning the the.

513
01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:16.860
Xiangguo Sun: gains or the benefits, where you active.

514
01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:20.070
Xiangguo Sun: knows.

515
01:48:22.050 --> 01:48:25.410
Xiangguo Sun: denoted by us and we just need to find.

516
01:48:27.150 --> 01:48:37.350
Xiangguo Sun: We need to compare a different strategy, for example, maybe some students may choose as the as the initial set some students may choose.

517
01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:48.120
Xiangguo Sun: AC as the initial set and some students may choose to add add that in the result but different initial station cars very different.

518
01:48:48.600 --> 01:49:02.310
Xiangguo Sun: You know influence or or different publications, so we did a compare the influence of what is two different offer the three strategy, and we want to find the larger ones, because.

519
01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:14.490
Xiangguo Sun: Because the initial because it did function larger doesn't mean we We just need to use lower cost to to promote our production.

520
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:22.830
Xiangguo Sun: And here we can find to to find the best choice of the.

521
01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:38.640
Xiangguo Sun: Initial attitude knows it's very hard at the actor cannot be calculated by by existing computer, so we call that an MP hard problem, but some students might be confused about is termed NP hard what's the main of me hard.

522
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:43.950
Xiangguo Sun: You don't understand the code this concept is totally out of scope.

523
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:56.940
Xiangguo Sun: If you want, if you're interested if you're only interested in that empty hard problem, maybe you need to first learn some you know some advanced algorithms and some do.

524
01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:15.600
Xiangguo Sun: You need a strong mathematical background, so I think that's means this graph the content of this style is not important it doesn't do be familiar with that you don't need to know that that the most influences that can be treated as a set of our problem that's enough.

525
01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:26.520
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so here I don't think the continent of these slides can be exam or finance down so just to be relaxed about that.

526
01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:45.840
Xiangguo Sun: And here we provide a great algorithm to help you to find the best choice of the initial set, but since we prepare said, we cannot find that the best that initial sad.

527
01:50:47.160 --> 01:51:01.290
Xiangguo Sun: Because it's empty heart problem so that mean this query the algorithm can not find the you know the the global optimal solution, but he can find that you know the local optimal solution.

528
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:24.270
Xiangguo Sun: So maybe the answers, or the results of this algorithm is no is better than you randomly select some notes, but apparently it cannot be guaranteed to find the best choice because if you come because, if it is a croma can find a better choice that means.

529
01:51:25.290 --> 01:51:28.980
Xiangguo Sun: All exist in the real world application can attribute their.

530
01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:34.200
Xiangguo Sun: Max know prohibit or mass.

531
01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:43.530
Xiangguo Sun: What personal best to up largest sorry larger the benefits right, but apparently that's not realistic it's not practical.

532
01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:51.450
Xiangguo Sun: So also just need to be familiar with that and they understand the theory and that's enough.

533
01:51:52.740 --> 01:52:06.210
Xiangguo Sun: Okay, so Essentially, we have introduced solid content on his face and again don't forget to do they have total wanted, because when you're on the go also you only have a few days are finished that.

534
01:52:07.410 --> 01:52:09.840
Xiangguo Sun: I do have any other concern here.

535
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:15.990
Xiangguo Sun: If you don't have any questions that come to the end of this tutorial.

536
01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:19.140
Xiangguo Sun: Okay.

537
01:52:20.850 --> 01:52:21.300
Xiangguo Sun: Okay.

538
01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:30.810
Xiangguo Sun: Thank you, thank you guys and today with how 34 students are coming here that's very amazing.

539
01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.010
Xiangguo Sun: I want to thank you for appearing compliment, thank you.

540
01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:36.870
Xiangguo Sun: See you.

541
01:52:49.170 --> 01:53:02.670
Xiangguo Sun: cannot discuss with you, but I can even though breaking out room and, yes, you can mean to me anytime but, but please you know, make it an appointment as it is to want to help because you know just.

542
01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:12.750
Xiangguo Sun: This afternoon I need to meet at that is the three students, so today might be not, but you can make an appointment later.

543
01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:28.650
Xiangguo Sun: send me email to to make an appointment and looking forward to meeting okay i'm going to stop my online tutorial Okay, thank you see ya.
