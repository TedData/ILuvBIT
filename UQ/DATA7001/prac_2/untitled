SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM student_data_anon WHERE gender = 'M' AND GPA > 4.0; #COUNT(*) 267
SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM student_data_anon WHERE gender = 'M' AND GPA > 4.0;  # COUNT(*) 267


SELECT AVG(GPA) FROM student_data_anon;
SELECT MAX(GPA) FROM student_data_anon;

SELECT postcode, AVG(GPA) FROM student_data_anon GROUP BY postcode ORDER BY 2;
4069
SELECT postcode, AVG(GPA) FROM student_data_anon GROUP BY postcode ORDER BY 2;
The postcode of the higest average GPA is 4069

The k-anonymity is level 2 ,MIN(mycount) 2. By searching unique combination of quasi-identifiers such as same gender, age, postcode, minimum two individuals' informeition will appear in the dataset.

we can see from the Bootstrapped Histogram that as the GPA goes up, the frequency goes up, but when the GPA equal to one value, the frequecy have a maximum. After that as the GPA goes up, the frequency decrease. the population of male greater than that female when the GPA less than 4.6, after that the population of female more than that man.

As shown by the histogram, the central tendency of the male mean GPA is between 4.4 and 4.5 while the female mean GPA is between 4.6 and 4.7. 
The values for male group mostly fall between 3.8 and 5.1 while for female group the range 4.0 and 5.1.

n=167, N=nrow(data)=835, k=N/n=5  167
k = N/n = nrow(data) / 167 = 835 / 167 = 5 , We have 167 kinds of different samples, 4.539 is the acerage GPAs
