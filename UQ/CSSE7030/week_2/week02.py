# Task 2
# Each line has the input (following >>>), the output, & then an explanation.

# >>> 3--2
# 5
# Order of operations specifies that the unary - (i.e. sign) happens
# before subtraction, so the result is 3 - (-2) = 5

# >>> 5 / 2
# 2.0
# A single / (forward slash) performs floating point division always resulting
# which always results in a floating point (decimal) answer

# >>> -5 / 2
# -2.5
# Similarly, as above

# >>> 5 // 2
# 2
# // is Integer division, which in Python is the same as dividing and then
# rounding down to the nearest integer.
# 5 divided by 2 = 2.5 => 2 (rounded down)

# >>> -5 // 2
# -3
# Similarly, as above, -5 divided by 2 = -2.5 => -3 (rounded down)

# >>> 5.0 / 2
# 2.5
# As single / as above anything will become float answer

# >>> 5.0 // 2
# 2.0
# With //, even if one of the numbers is a float it will perform the equivalent
# of the integer division, but will result in a float answer (rounded down).

# >>> 3.0 - 5 / 2
# 0.5
# Operator precedence is taken into account when multiple operators are
# involved. / and * have precedence over + and - (meaning they get calculated
# first). Same as:
# 3.0 - (5/2) => 3.0 - 2.5 => 0.5

# >>> 3.0 - 5 // 2
# 1.0
# The // operator is of equal precedence to to /. This means that the
# expression is equivalent to:
# 3.0 - (5//2) => 3.0 - 2 => 1.0

# >>> '3' + '12'
# '312'
# The + operator for strings concatenates them (i.e. joins them together).

# >>> 3 + '12'
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
# A number and a string cannot be added/concatenated.

# >>> 3 * '12'
# '121212'
# Multiplying a number (n) by a string (s), or vice-versa, results in the
# string s being repeated n times.

# >>> 'ba'+'na' * 2
# 'banana'
# Similarly to 3.0 - 5 / 2, * takes precedence over +, so the result is
# equivalent to 'ba' + ('na' * 2) => 'ba' + 'nana' => 'banana'

# >>> 'hello' - 'o'
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
# The - operation is not defined for strings.

# >>> 'ababab' / 3
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'
# Similarly to above, the / operation is not defined for a string and an
# integer.

# >>> 2 ** 3
# 8
# a ** b raises a to the power of b, so 2 ** 3 => 2 to the power of 3.

# >>> 9 ** 1/2
# 4.5
# Operator precedence dictates that ** happens before /, so the result is
# equivalent to (9 ** 1)/2 => 9/2 => 4.5 (float division)

# >>> 11 % 4
# 3
# The modulo operator, a % b (read "a modulo b" or "a mod b"), gives the
# remainder of a divided by b.

# >>> -11 % 4
# 1
# As above, but it must be noted that 0 <= remainder < b (if b is > 0). It
# can easily be calculated by asking, What is the difference between a and
# smallest (i.e. closest to zero) multiple of b less than a. Here b = 4,
# a = -11. The smallest multiple of 4 less than -11 is -12 (= -3 * 4), and
# the difference between -11 and -12 is 1 (= -11 - (-12) => -11 + 12)

# >>> 'Tim' > 'Tom'
# False
# Ordering of strings is determined by position on the ascii table. The
# ordering of letters and numbers is A-Z then a-z then 0-9. Each character is
# compared, and if they are the same, then the next character is compared,
# and so on. First 'T' is compared with 'T'. Since 'T' == 'T', the next
# character from each string is compared (i.e. 'i' and 'o'). 'i' comes before
# 'o' (since they are the same case, and i precedes o in the alphabet), so
# 'i' is less than 'o', which is not greater, so the result is False. If the
# input strings are equal, then greater than or less than would both return
# False.

# >>> 'A' < 'a'
# True
# As above, capitals precede lower case letters, so 'A' comes before 'a', and
# hence 'A' < 'a', so the result is True.

# Task 3
"""Prints True iff year is a leap year, False otherwise."""
# Note: iff is read as "if and only if"

year = int(input("Please enter a year to check if it is a leap year: "))

# A year is a leap year if it is divisible by four and either is not
# divisible by 100 or is divisible by 400.

    print(True)
elif year % 100 == 0 :
    print(False)
elif year % 4 == 0 :
    print(True)
else :
    print(False)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# It is important to note that we must consider the most specific case
# first. This is because, when we check for the year being a multiple of
# 100, we are implying that the year is not a multiple of 400. If we
# wrote:
# if year % 100 == 0:
#     return False
# elif year % 400 == 0:
#     return True
# etc.
# then the second case would never happen, because any year that is
# divisible by 400 would also be divisible by 100, and only one branch
# in an if/elif/else is executed. To avoid this, we want to say that we
# only consider the case in which the year is divisible by 100 if it is
# not also divisible by 100. I.e.
# if year % 100 == 0 and not(year % 400 == 0):
#     return False
# elif year % 400 == 0:
#     return True
# etc.
# 
# But it should be noted, that if we swap the branches, we will only
# consider the second case (i.e. year % 100) if the first is not true,
# so we have not(year % 400 == 0) implicitly in the above solution.
#
# Here is a test that is probably harder to read but significantly shorter:
# year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
